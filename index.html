      <p>I'm a scientist aiming to understand the training dynamics of deep neural networks. I currently run a small lab within the <a href="https://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center</a> and am supported by <a href="https://imbue.com/">Imbue</a>, where I am a research fellow. I recently finished my PhD, advised by <a href="https://deweeselab.com/">Mike DeWeese</a>. In my free time, I like running, puzzles, spending time in forests, and <a href="gravitrees.com">balancing things</a>.

      A lot of my papers have come about from helping people doing (mostly) empirical ML research come up with good minimal theoretical toy models that explain effects they're seeing
      [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10397">1</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06569">2</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11774">3</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13185">4</a>,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04642">5</a>].

      <h3>More is better: when infinite overparameterization is optimal and overfitting is obligatory</h3>
      <strong>Explaining mysteries of modern ML with the toy model of RF regression</strong>
      <p class="blurb"> We give a theory of the generalization of random feature models. We conclude they perform better with more parameters, more data, and less regularization, putting theoretical backing to these observations in modern ML. This gives a fairly solid mathematical picture to replace classical intuitions about the risks of overparameterization and overfitting. Our picture of the generalization of RF models takes the form of some nice closed-form equations we think can be used to answer lots of other questions. </p>

      <p class="blurb"> We give a theory of the training dynamics of contrastive self-supervised learning and validate it empirically. We find that representations are learned <i> one dimension at a time in a stepwise fashion </i> -- that is, the rank of the model's final representations increases by one at each step. Our theory is derived for linearized models, but we clearly see our stepwise phenomenon even for ResNets trained on image data. Large-scale ML mostly uses unsupervised and self-supervised training these days, and we describe a behavior we think is fairly generic in SSL. </p>

      <h3>Reverse engineering the neural tangent kernel</h3>
      <strong>A first-principles method for the design of fully-connected architectures</strong>
      <p class="blurb"> Much of our understanding of artificial neural networks stems from the fact that, in the infinite-width limit, they turn out to be equivalent to a class of simple models called <i>kernel regression.</i> Given a wide network architecture, it's well-known how to find the equivalent kernel method, allowing us to study popular models in the infinite-width limit. In work with Sajant Anand, we <i>invert this mapping</i> for fully-connected nets (FCNs), allowing one to start from a desired rotation-invariant kernel and design a network (i.e. choose an activation function) to achieve it. Remarkably, achieving any such kernel requires only one hidden layer, raising questions about conventional wisdom on the benefits of depth. This allows surprising experiments, like designing a 1HL FCN that trains and generalizes like a deep ReLU FCN. This ability to design nets with desired kernels is a step towards deriving good net architectures <i>from first principles</i>, a longtime dream of the field of machine learning. </p>

      <h3>Benign, tempered or catastrophic: a taxonomy of overfitting</h3>
      <strong>How bad is neural network overfitting?</strong>
      <p class="blurb"> Classical wisdom holds that overparameterization is harmful. Neural nets defy this wisdom, generalizing well despite their overparameterization and interpolation of the training data. How can we understand this discrepancy? Recent landmark papers have explored the concept of <i>benign overfitting</i> -- a phenomenon in which certain models can interpolate noisy data without harming generalization -- suggesting that that neural nets may fit benignly. In this work with <a href="https://mallinar.xyz/">Neil Mallinar</a>, <a href="https://preetum.nakkiran.org/">Preetum Nakkiran</a>, and others, we put this idea to the empirical test, giving a new characterization of neural network overfitting and noise sensitivity. We find that neural networks trained to interpolation do <i>not</i> overfit benignly, but neither do they exhibit the catastrophic overfitting foretold by classical wisdom: instead, they usually lie in a third, intermediate regime we call <i>tempered overfitting</i>. I found that we can understand these three regimes of overfitting analytically for kernel regression (a toy model for neural networks), and I proved a simple "trichotomy theorem" relating a kernel's eigenspectrum to its overfitting behavior. </p>

      <h3>Critical point-finding methods reveal gradient-flat regions of deep network losses</h3>
      <strong>Exposing flaws in widely-used critical-point-finding methods</strong>
      <p class="blurb"> Despite how common and useful neural networks are, there are still basic mysteries about how they work, many related to properties of their loss surfaces. In this project, led by <a href="https://charlesfrye.github.io/">Charles Frye</a>, we tested Newton methods (common tools for optimization and exploring function structure) on loss surfaces. We found that, as opposed to finding critical points as designed, in practice Newton methods almost always converged to a different, spurious class of points which we described. Giving simple visualizable examples to illustrate the problem, we showed that some major studies using Newton methods on loss surfaces probably misinterpreted their results. Our paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10397.pdf">here</a>. </p>

      <h3>Fast noise-resistant control of donor nuclear spin qubits in silicon</h3>
      <strong>Better control schemes for for spin qubits</strong>
      <p class="blurb"> Qubits decohere and lose their quantum information when uncontrollably coupled to their environment. Nuclear spin qubits in silicon are extremely weakly coupled to their environment, giving them long coherence times (up to minutes), but that same weak coupling makes quickly controlling them difficult. Advised by Prof. <a href="http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~economou/index.html">Sophia Economou</a>, I came up with schemes for driving nuclear spin qubits that give fast, noise-resistant arbitrary single-qubit gates. The most important gate is a long sweep that effectively turns uncertainty in electric field (charge noise) into uncertainty in time, which can be accounted for by corrective gates. We also show two-qubit gates. </p>
