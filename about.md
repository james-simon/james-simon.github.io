My name is Charles Frye and I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley in the
[Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/)
working in the
[Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/).

My research interests include
neural network optimization
and computational Bayesian methods.
My research is supported by the National Science Foundation's
Graduate Research Fellowship.

I grew up in Southern Illinois, in a town called
[Kankakee](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/554/not-it),
and attended high school at the
[Illinois Math and Science Academy](https://www.imsa.edu)
in Aurora, IL, graduating in 2009.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in
Computational Neuroscience at the University of Chicago in 2013.
