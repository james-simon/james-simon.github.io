<p>My name is Charles Frye and I’m a graduate student at UC Berkeley in the
<a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>
working in the
<a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include
neural network optimization
and computational Bayesian methods.
My research is supported by the National Science Foundation’s
Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>

<p>I grew up in Southern Illinois, in a town called
<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/554/not-it">Kankakee</a>,
and attended high school at the
<a href="https://www.imsa.edu">Illinois Math and Science Academy</a>

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in
Computational Neuroscience at the University of Chicago in 2013.</p>
