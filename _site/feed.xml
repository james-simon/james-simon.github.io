&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Carson-MicroBrite-60x-120x-Lighted-Microscope/dp/B00LAX52IQ&quot;&gt;small handheld microscope&lt;/a&gt; around my house.
For such a cheap instrument, the world it reveals is truly remarkable.
I highly recommend getting one.

        <title>The sixth lake</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin: 0 auto;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;/img/boolpool_timelapse/boolpool_timelapse.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit Tahoe’s Five Lakes and wander off-trail in just the right direction, making your way over granite scree and thin alpine topsoil, past windworn pines and views to infinity, you will reach a sixth lake.
It is perched in a high hollow, frozen and unreachable half the year, quite indifferent to the doings of man. Its shores are lined with evergreens, its face reflects the sky, and every day for thousands of years it has born witness to the drama of the High Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were just warm apes, fast and impatient creatures there for a thrill. We were interlopers, protected by our synthetic fabrics and eating our processed foods. Wrapped all around in our human comforts, it wasn’t so easy for us to really take in the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lake is animated endlessly by forces too big and slow for most of us to see and understand in realtime. The snow sheets drift ploddingly around the pond like tectonic plates, colliding and melting. The wind dances on the water, rippling first one region, then another, the surface revealing the streaming clouds each time it settles to placidity and scrambling them with the return of the waves, again and again. The pines, too, are duplicated in the pond, their reflections growing downwards, slowly, slowly. The sunlight glows long and white, then blazes orange and begins to fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drama, or one similar, repeats every day. A single glance finds an armada of powerful natural processes that shape the scene, great and grand and far beyond our control. With a long and patient look, you can start to see them do their work. And the pond bears witness, day after day, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It changes you to realize this, to see the processes of nature and know their vastness and unstoppability. A vast quiet settles over you. Perhaps you see that you, too, are a phenomenon of this sort – that a few warm apes appearing and disappearing from the side of the pond isn’t so different from the play of the wind on its surface or a deer’s stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to see this. I only truly feel this now, typing on my laptop in my comfortable Berkeley home, watching this looping timelapse, letting myself fade from the observer into part of the scene. As I do, I’m reminded of some wise words recently given to me by a friend: “we’re all just here to look around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Noah Sailer for suggesting a timelapse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using the Laplacian to take a local average of a function</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Laplacian operator in $d$ dimensions is defined as $\nabla^2 \equiv \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2}$. It’s widely used to model diffusion processes in physics — for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation&quot;&gt;heat equation&lt;/a&gt;, which describes the diffusion of heat through a material, is given by $\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 f(\mathbf{x}, t)$. This operator’s come up in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/1nn-eigenframework&quot;&gt;my recent thinking about the 1NN algorithm&lt;/a&gt;: in particular, I’ve been trying to write down a linear operator that replaces a function with its local average, and I had a sense that you could probably do this with the Laplacian somehow. In thinking this through, I encountered something neat I hadn’t appreciated before: for any analytic function $f$, it holds that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
$$
\left( e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla^2} f \right)(\mathbf x) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\delta}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}_d)}[f(\mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\delta})].
$$
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the (exponentiated) Laplacian of a function (LHS) is equal to its local average w.r.t. a Gaussian measure (RHS). The RHS is nonlocal, but the LHS is entirely local, so this has some spooky-action-at-a-distance vibes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this the case? I’ll give two explanations in 1D, and it’ll be relatively clear how to extend it to higher dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;argument-from-discretization-of-space&quot;&gt;Argument from discretization of space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Laplacian can be understood intuitively as the limit of its definition on a discretized lattice as the lattice spacing goes to zero. Suppose that instead of a function over the reals, the function $f$ only takes values on the points $\epsilon \mathbb{Z}$ — that is, ${\ldots, -2\epsilon, -\epsilon, 0, \epsilon, 2\epsilon, \ldots }$ — for some small value of $\epsilon$. We could represent the &lt;em&gt;derivative&lt;/em&gt; of $f$ as&lt;/p&gt;

\[(Df)(x) = \frac{f(x + \epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon},\]

&lt;p&gt;where $x \in \epsilon \mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, we can define the Laplacian as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left( \nabla^2 f \right)(x) = \frac{f(x - \epsilon) - 2 f(x) + f(x + \epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}.\]

&lt;p&gt;If we add the identity to the Laplacian operator, we see that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left( \left[1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4} \nabla^2 \right] f \right)(x) = \frac{f(x - \epsilon) + 2 f(x) + f(x + \epsilon)}{4}.\]

&lt;p&gt;(The choice of $\frac{1}{4}$ as the prefactor here is arbitrary, but will make things simpler.) We see then that the operator $1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4} \nabla^2$ takes a weighted average of the function value at a point and its two neighbors (with weights $\frac 14, \frac 12, \frac 14$ respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this as a single step of a random walk. Taking a dual view where instead of staying fixed at the point $x$, we follow the diffusion of the function mass that &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; at $x$, we see that $\frac 14$ of the mass has gone one point to the left, $\frac 12$ of the mass has remained in place, and $\frac 14$ of the mass has moved one point to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many steps, a random walk on an infinite lattice approaches a (discretized) Gaussian distribution by the central limit theorem. In particular, if we take $n \gg 1$ steps, the corresponding Gaussian will have a variance of $\frac {\epsilon^2 n}{2}$. If we choose $n = \frac{2 \sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}$, we get a Gaussian with variance $\sigma^2$, which gives us the RHS of the boxed equation above!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the LHS, since we’ve iterated this operator $n$ times, it corresponds to&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left[1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4} \nabla^2 \right]^n = \left[1 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{4} \nabla^2 \right]^{\frac{2 \sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}}
\xrightarrow{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}
e^{\frac {\sigma^2} 2 \nabla^2}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Great! Let’s test this conclusion on the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. Let $f_k(x) = e^{i k x}$. Then&lt;/p&gt;

\[e^{\frac {\sigma^2} 2 \nabla^2} f_k = e^{- \frac {\sigma^2 k^2} 2} f_k\]

&lt;p&gt;and also, using the standard Gaussian integral, we find that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbb{E}_{\delta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)}[f_k(x + \delta)] = e^{- \frac {\sigma^2 k^2} 2} f_k.\]

&lt;p&gt;Great! Actually, since the boxed relation holds for the complete Fourier basis, it’ll hold for all functions (or at least all functions that equal their Fourier series).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;argument-from-taylor-series&quot;&gt;Argument from Taylor series&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the function $f(x) = x^a$ for some $a \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. A standard Gaussian integral yields that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbb{E}_{\delta \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)}[\delta^a] =
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}        \frac{a!}{2^{a/2} (a/2)!} \sigma^a &amp;amp; \text{for } a \text{ even}, \\        0 &amp;amp; \text{for } a \text{ odd}.        \end{array}\right.\]

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the LHS of the boxed equation gives the same result — this is easiest to show starting by writing out&lt;/p&gt;

\[e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla^2} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left[1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{2n} \nabla^2 f \right]^n\]

&lt;p&gt;and then expanding the right hand side. Anyways, the fact that the boxed equation holds for any monomial around zero is sufficient to argue that any function that converges to its Taylor series (that is, any analytic function) satisfies the boxed equation. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a closing thought, there’s a potential paradox raised by the boxed equation, which is: how can you take a &lt;em&gt;nonlocal&lt;/em&gt; average of a function with the Laplacian, which is a local operator?
The answer is that the exponentiation actually means that we’re applying the Laplacian an infinite number of times – it’s rather more believable that this counteracts the locality of the operator, especially in light of our discretized model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, one more closing thought: so the boxed equation tells us how to study the local &lt;em&gt;Gaussian&lt;/em&gt; average… what if we wanted, say, the local &lt;em&gt;Laplacian&lt;/em&gt; average, or some other rotation-invariant distribution?
Well, you could just represent that distribution in the basis of Gaussians of different widths, and then you’ve got it – you’ll just have some sum or integral over different values of \(\sigma^2\) on the LHS of the boxed equation.
That seems useful because I actually needed a Laplacian average for the 1NN analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A eigenframework for the generalization of 1NN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blogpost, I’ll present an eigenframework giving the generalization of the nearest-neighbor algorithm (1NN) on two simple domains — the unit circle and the 2-torus — and discuss the prospects for a general theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-1nn&quot;&gt;Why 1NN?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think 1NN is a good candidate for &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/lets-solve-learning-rules&quot;&gt;“solving” in the omniscient sense&lt;/a&gt; because it’s relatively simple, and it’s also a &lt;em&gt;linear learning rule&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that, condition on a dataset, the predicted function $\hat{f}$ is a linear function of the true function $f$. This means that we might expect a nice eigenframework to work for MSE.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1nn-on-the-unit-circle-aka-the-1-torus&quot;&gt;1NN on the unit circle (aka the 1-torus)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting here will be pretty natural: we have some target function $f: [0,1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ we wish to learn, we draw $n$ samples \(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n\) from $U[0,1)$ and obtain noisy function evaluations $y_i = f(x_i) + \mathcal{N}(0, \epsilon^2)$, and then on each test point $x$ predict $y_{i(x)}$ where $i(x)$ is the index of the closest point to $x$, with circular boundary conditions on the domain. Here’s what it looks like to learn, say, a triangle wave with 20 points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1nn_eigenframework/sawtooth_realspace_1nn_plot.png&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will describe generalization in terms of the &lt;em&gt;Fourier decomposition&lt;/em&gt; of the target function $f(x) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi i k x} v_k,$ where ${ v_k }$ are the Fourier coefficients. In terms of the Fourier decomposition, we have that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
$$
[\text{test MSE}]_\text{1D} = \sum_k \frac{2 \pi^2 k^2}{\pi^2 k^2 + n^2} \, v_k^2 + 2 \epsilon^2. 
$$
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the eigenframework for 1NN in 1D! The generalization of 1NN on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; target function in 1D is described by this equation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some experiments that show we’ve got it right. The function $\phi_k(x)$ here is the $k$th eigenmode, and we’re using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeriesTriangleWave.html&quot;&gt;known Fourier decomposition of the triangle wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1nn_eigenframework/1nn_1d_learning_curves.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equation can be found a few ways, but most simply you (a) argue by symmetry that the eigenmodes contribute independently to MSE and then (b) find the test MSE for a particular eigenmode, which isn’t too hard to do. I made two approximations: (1) instead of having exactly $n$ samples, I let the samples be distributed as a Poisson process (i.e., each point has an i.i.d. chance of containing a sample), and (2) I assume the domain is infinite when computing a certain integral. Neither of these matters when $n$ is moderately large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on to the 2D case, I want to pause to highlight a few cool features of this framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Fourier modes do not interact — no crossterms $v_j v_k$ appear in the framework. Because 1NN is a linear learning rule, it’s inevitably possible to “diagonalize” the theory in this way for a particular $n$, but the fact that it’s simultaneously diagonalizable for all $n$ is pretty cool!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ignoring the factors of $\pi$, we see that mode $k$ is unlearned when $n \ll k$ and fully learned when $n \gg k$. This makes a lot of sense — it’s sort of a soft version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency&quot;&gt;Nyquist frequency&lt;/a&gt; cutoff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things simplify a bit if, instead of using the index $k$, we write in terms of the Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_k = 4 \pi^2 k^2$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1nn-on-the-2-torus&quot;&gt;1NN on the 2-Torus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now undertake the same problem, but we’re in 2D: our data is i.i.d. from $[0,1)^2$, again with circular boundary conditions. Our Fourier decomposition now looks like&lt;/p&gt;

\[f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{Z}^2} e^{2 \pi i \, \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The same procedure as in the 1D case yields that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
$$
[\text{test MSE}]_\text{2D} = \sum_\mathbf{k} \left( 2 - 2 e^{- \pi \mathbf{k}^2 / n} \right) \, v_\mathbf{k}^2 + 2 \epsilon^2. 
$$
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some experiments that show that we’ve got the 2D case right, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/1nn_eigenframework/1nn_2d_learning_curves.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-you-extend-these-to-k-nearest-neighbors-instead-of-just-one&quot;&gt;Can you extend these to k nearest neighbors instead of just one?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably! I haven’t tried, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-we-find-a-general-theory&quot;&gt;Can we find a general theory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable feature of the eigenframework for linear regression is that one set of equations works for every distribution. Can we find that here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure. At first blush, the 1D and 2D equations look pretty different — if we were in search of some master equation, we’d almost certainly want it to unify those two cases, but the functional forms look pretty different! I suspect it might be possible, though — the linear regression eigenframework requires solving an implicit equation that depends on all the eigenvalues and can yield pretty different-looking final expressions for different spectra, so it’s believable to me that there’s some common thread here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big question in the search for a general eigenframework is: what’s the right notion of &lt;em&gt;eigenfunction?&lt;/em&gt; In these highly symmetric domains, it’s easy — the Fourier modes are the eigenfunctions of any translation-invariant operator we might choose. In general, though, I don’t know what operator we want to diagonalize, or how to use its eigenvalues. This puzzles me. I don’t know the answer! So strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without a general theory, though, I think it’d be really interesting just to continue this chain of special cases up to the arbitrary $d$-torus! I got stuck at $d=2,$ but I’d bet it can be done. Then we could think about how 1NN differs from kernel regression in high dimensions!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My understanding is that 1NN is worse, but I don’t actually know any quantification of this. (If you know one, drop me a line!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s where things stand: these two special cases serve as proof of principle that there &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be a general eigenframework for 1NN… and if that exists, it’d be a cool proof of principle that more learning rules than linear regression can be “solved.” Seems like a neat problem! If I make much more progress on it, maybe I’ll write up a little paper. Let me know if you have thoughts or want to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the fact that it’s linear also means that 1NN exactly satisfies the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922&quot;&gt;“conservation of learnability” condition&lt;/a&gt; obeyed by linear and kernel regression, which means that you can ask questions about how these two different algorithms allocate their budget of learnability differently. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our Fourier decomposition is easily adapted to nonuniform data distros on our domain.] In order to understand the generalization of 1NN on a target function, it suffices to compute its Fourier transform and stick the result into this equation. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is particularly interesting because it could let us get at a puzzle posed by Misha Belkin &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14368&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of why &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; methods like KRR outperform &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; methods like kNN and kernel smoothing in high dimensions. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let's solve more learning rules</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: the field now has an “omniscient solution” for the generalization of linear regression. We should try to find comparable solutions for other simple learning rules, like k-nearest-neighbors and kernel smoothing!
This post is motivation for &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/1nn-eigenframework&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, where I give a partial omniscient solution to the nearest-neighbor algorithm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro-what-does-it-mean-to-solve-a-learning-rule&quot;&gt;Intro: what does it mean to “solve” a learning rule?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially all of machine learning theory aims to understand the performance and behavior of different schemes for making predictions on unseen data. This is often very difficult. Given the amount of effort expended in this direction, it’s worth stepping back and asking what we’re ultimately trying to do here — that is, how will we know when we’re done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, one gold-standard answer is the following: &lt;strong&gt;for each learning rule under study, we want a simple set of equations that tells us how well the learning rule will perform&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of the task eigenstructure and number of samples $n$&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t the only thing we might want, but it’s clearly a powerful milestone: you could use such a theory to work out when the algorithm will perform well or poorly, and in order to derive the theory you’d have to understand a lot about the behavior of the learning rule. Viewing each learning rule as presenting a puzzle for theorists, I’d consider the development of such a theory as tantamount to “solving” the learning rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important clarification is that this is an “omniscient” solution in the sense that you assume complete and exact knowledge of the training task. This isn’t very useful by itself as a practical tool, but it is very useful for conceptual understanding of the learning rule (e.g. for characterizing its inductive bias). In light of this, to be more precise, we’ll say that this sort of theory is an “omniscient solution” for a learning rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, one of the most significant recent developments in machine learning theory is that &lt;em&gt;we have an omniscient solution for linear regression!&lt;/em&gt; That is, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2001/hash/d68a18275455ae3eaa2c291eebb46e6d-Abstract.html&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2002.02561&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09796&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08571&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/9704a4fc48ae88598dcbdcdf57f3fdef-Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08560&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;, we now have a simple set of closed-form equations that accurately predict the test performance of linear regression in terms of the task eigenstructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some flavor for how this theory looks. First, we define an orthonormal basis of functions ${ \phi_k }$ over the input space. (In the case of linear regression, these are linear functions and are the principal directions of the feature covariance matrix.) We then decompose the target function $f$ into this basis as&lt;/p&gt;

\[f(x) = \sum_k v_k \phi_k(x)\]

&lt;p&gt;where ${ v_k }$ are the eigencoefficients. (Noise may also be included, but I omit it here for simplicity.) The eigenframework then takes the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{test MSE} = \sum_k g(n, k)  \, v_k^2,\]

&lt;p&gt;where $g(n,k)$ tells you what fraction of the signal in mode $k$ contributes to test error at $n$ samples. (The function $g(n,k)$ typically decreases to zero as $n$ grows.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some remarkable facts about this eigenframework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It gives accurate predictions of test MSE even on real data!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The eigenmodes don’t interact! That is, there are no crossterms $v_j v_k$ in the final expression.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s very mathematically simple! In particular, the function $g$ isn’t too complicated, I just didn’t want to get into the details here. It’s simple enough that you can study it in various limits to really get intuition for how linear regression generalizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a big fan of results of this type.&lt;/strong&gt; They feel like the way to make progress in this field: rather than showing every new result from square one, first we derive this simple and general eigenframework &lt;em&gt;once,&lt;/em&gt; and then can use it as a starting point to compute other quantities — error bounds, convergence rates, effects of dimensionality, effects of regularization, and more.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how physics (and specifically statistical mechanics) works — when studying a complex system, you first seek a simple effective theory for the system, and then can easily ask lots of downstream questions about the &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;call-to-action-lets-solve-more-learning-rules&quot;&gt;Call to action: &lt;em&gt;let’s solve more learning rules!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above omniscient solution for linear regression has been very impactful. We should try to do this for more learning rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning rules like k-nearest-neighbors (kNN), kernel smoothing, spline interpolation, decision trees, clustering, SVMs, and generalized additive models are widely used in practice, but we do not understand any of them as well as we now understand linear regression. It would be very impactful to solve any of them. Furthermore, the first three — kNN, kernel smoothing, and spline interpolation — are &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; learning rules in the sense that the predicted function depends linearly on the training targets (i.e., the training $y$’s), which suggests that an eigenframework of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; type as that for linear regression might be possible. These last three seem simple enough that you might be able to solve them in one paper!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that omnisciently solving more learning rules would have a large impact — potentially a paradigm-altering impact, actually. Right now, all these learning rules are just a bag of disjoint algorithms: we don’t really understand any of them individually, and we sure don’t understand how they relate to each other. Any intuition I have about their relative performance is extremely ad-hoc — for example, kNN works best in low dimensions and at low noise, SVMs are often better in high dimensions, decision trees work well when different features have different notions of distance, and so on. &lt;strong&gt;If we understood all these learning rules in the same way as we understand linear regression, we could compare them on the same footing!&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of a bunch of ad-hoc intuitions, we could start to think of all these learning rules in one unified way. This feels like a place that machine learning ought to eventually get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/1nn-eigenframework&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll give the solution for 1NN on the unit circle and 2-torus and discuss what it might look like to solve 1NN in general!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06569&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13185&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14646&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; in which I’ve used this eigenframework as a starting point to easily derive other results. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Two other learning rules: obviously we’d all love to understand neural networks, but they’re still too poorly understood for a theory of generalization, I think — we need to understand more about their dynamics first. Second, random feature (RF) regression is a nice generalization of linear regression — and I derived an eigenframework for RF regression for &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14646&quot;&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; ;) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Ibuprofen vs. aspirin vs naproxen vs acetaminophen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, and acetaminophen are the most common drugs for pain relief.
They’re staples of the modern pharmaceutical arsenal, and they’re in virtually every American home.
After years of not bothering to learn the difference between them, I finally sat down and did it yesterday, and I figured I’d write this as a reference.
I’ll give a bit about each drug, and then close with some bigger questions that feel interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-drug-facts&quot;&gt;Basic drug facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen&lt;/strong&gt; (brand names Advil, Motrin) is a “non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug” (NSAID).
As the term suggests, it’s an anti-inflammatory drug, so it’s particularly useful for treating pain caused by inflammation, including headaches, menstrual cramps, and arthritis.
It works by temporarily binding to (and thus interfering with) “cyclooxygenase” (COX) enzymes which produce prostaglandins, which are involved in pathways for inflammation.
It was developed in the 1960s as a safer alternative to aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspirin&lt;/strong&gt; (which apparently has no brand names) is a different NSAID.
It’s sometimes prescribed for long-term use as a means of reducing the risk of heart attacks.
It also works by binding to COX enzymes, but interesting, in the case of aspirin, this binding is permanent – it stays bound until the enzyme is destroyed!
It’s pretty old – it was developed in the late 1890s!
It’s more dangerous than ibuprofen, though, with more risk of side effects on the digestive system, which I imagine is why ibuprofen is the more common over-the-counter medication these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naproxen&lt;/strong&gt; (brand name Aleve) is also an NSAID and also dates from the 1960s.
It acts very similarly to ibuprofen, but it lasts maybe 2x longer (but takes a bit longer to kick in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt; (brand name Tylenol; also called paracetamol internationally) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a NSAID.
It still affects the same pathway as NSAIDs, though, interfering with COX enzymes, and generally seems pretty similar, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://now.tufts.edu/2022/09/14/how-does-acetaminophen-work&quot;&gt;it’s still a mystery how exactly it works.&lt;/a&gt;
It has fewer side effects, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; seems to have much higher risks of overdose – in fact, it’s responsible for more overdoses than any other drug in the Western world!
It seems to primarily harm the liver and combine particularly poorly with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my home growing up, there was also a small bottle of something called “excedrin.” Somewhat ridiculously, this looks to be a combination of aspirin, acetaminophen, and &lt;em&gt;caffeine&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-are-these-things-anyways&quot;&gt;So what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; these things anyways?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These drug facts are well and good – it’s nice to know the &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; of these substances – but what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they?
Each substance consists of just one fairly small molecule.
Here they are – see if you can guess which is which. Answers are at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/pain_relievers/structures.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it pretty amazing that these small molecules can have such specific effects!
The body is huge and has a truly immense number of processes going all the time, and these molecules are taken orally and presumably spread throughout most of the body, and they &lt;em&gt;don’t seem complicated enough&lt;/em&gt; to be addressed to a very specific function, and yet they specifically target one particular enzyme in one particular pathway.
It’s even more surprising to me that multiple simple molecules all do this job – though perhaps that’s just an indication that that enzyme is easily messed with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at these molecular structures, I’m reminded anew of how weird and unintuitive biochemistry tends to be.
If you show me a picture of a mechanical part and tell me what it does, I can generally imagine how it might perform that role, and how a similar part might not be as good a choice for it, but I almost never have this experience looking at a biomolecule, and when I find out how the biomolecule works, it usually sounds ad hoc and overly complicated to me!
I wonder if learning some basic biochemistry would make things seem more mechanically intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The molecules are 1) naproxen, 2) aspirin, 3) ibuprofen, and 4) acetaminophen. I have no idea how you could guess this, so congratulations if you did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Geometric patterns in croplands</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve lived in California for five years now and have had the good fortune to roam up and down the state and see its mountains, valleys, and deserts.
As any outdoorsy Californian will know, these treks often featured long drives through the Central Valley, past wide fields of California crops: fruits, nuts, grain.
As a frequent passenger in these drives, I’ve come to look forward to gazing out a changing windowful of cropland, particularly when it makes a certain sort of geometric pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with this effect, take a minute to really examine the strip of field planted with the baby trees.
As you scan across the strip, you’ll notice places where the saplings form lines leading off into the distance.
The lines have different degrees of definition, and the gaps between the lines have different sizes in different places.
The “regions” of lines seem to have a curious fractal pattern: if you look between two neighboring line-regions, you’ll find another, smaller set of more closely spaced lines, and so on recursively.
I find it mysterious and beautiful.
For fun, you can click on the above image to be taken to the corresponding spot in Google Streetview if you want to explore it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/cropland_with_regions.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regions pop out to the eye even more when you’re moving! Here’s a gif of the view out my window as I drove by the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/croprow_gif.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s going on? In this post, I’ll explain why we see these “open” directions and try to explain why the overall visual effect is so fractally.
The basic explanation of the open regions will need only some simple math used in the physics of crystals.
When we try to understand the fractally effect, we’ll encounter some cool number theory.
I’ll end with a neat numerical experiment and an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-open-directions-of-an-infinite-lattice&quot;&gt;The open directions of an infinite lattice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the special directions is easily understood starting from the observation that these saplings are planted in a near-perfect rectangular grid.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:f&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:f&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
In such a grid, one expects the plants to leave “aisles” along the grid directions, and if one plays around with a drawing of a grid, one soon observes that the points also form narrower isles in other, off-axis directions.
See the colored “aisles” in the illustration below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/grid_gap_illustration.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three examples in the above illustration correspond to particular “lattice vector” – that is, vectors \((a, b)\) with integer components, with \(a, b\) “irreducible” – that is, sharing no factors greater than \(1\).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:q&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:q&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
It turns out that all “open directions” – that is, directions one can look without hitting (or passing arbitrarily close to) a tree – correspond to such lattice vector!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above illustration highlights the gaps between the rows of trees, but we might similarly talk about the rows of trees lying &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the colored rectangles.
This is the perspective taken in crystallography.
The atoms in a crystal form a regular lattice by definition, and this lattice can be decomposed into many parallel rows (or &lt;em&gt;sheets&lt;/em&gt; in 3D), and light of the appropriate frequency will scatter off these surfaces as if they were partially reflective mirrors.
This is a common experimental technique for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography&quot;&gt;identifying different crystals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-open-directions-will-you-see&quot;&gt;Which open directions will you see?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great – we now have a rule describing our open directions: every direction in which one can gaze unblocked off to infinity is parallel to a lattice vector \((a, b)\), where \(a, b\) are an irreducible pair of integers.
When we look out at a big field, we should thus see a total number of… *&lt;em&gt;furiously counting on fingers&lt;/em&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;infinitely many&lt;/strong&gt; open directions, one for every \((a, b)\).
Well, that doesn’t seem right, looking at our photograph above – what’s gone wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three things.
First, the field in the photo above is finite, and there are some directions we don’t see that would emerge if the field were extended.
Second, our camera has finite resolution.
Third, the trees have &lt;em&gt;nonzero width&lt;/em&gt; – some lattice directions give wider “aisles” than others, and if an aisle’s narrower than the size of a tree, we won’t see it even provided an infinite field and perfect camera.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:a&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:a&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these effects point to a general conclusion: &lt;strong&gt;wider “aisles” are more visually salient.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’d thus be useful to know the “aisle width” (or equivalent the “lattice row spacing”) corresponding to a particular lattice direction.
Some quick geometry tells us that, with pointlike trees on a unit lattice, the aisle width in direction \((a, b)\) is \(w_{a,b} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}.\)
This gives us a satisfying ordering of lattice directions: a lattice direction \((a, b)\) is more visually salient the smaller \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) is – that is, the closer it is to the origin!
We should thus expect the directions \((0, \pm 1)\) and \((\pm 1, 0)\) to appear most visually striking, followed by \((\pm 1, \pm 1)\), then \((\pm 1, \pm 2)\) and \((\pm 2, \pm 1)\), and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve annotated our original image with the actual lattice directions.
This is precisely what we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/cropland_with_regions_labeled.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the different lattice directions look like they’re parallel in this image, but they actually point radially outwards from the camera at different angles.
If we had an infinite field and a camera of good enough precision, we’d expect to see open directions corresponding to all irreducible \((a, b)\) such that \(w_{a, b}\) is less than the width of one sapling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fancy-math-farey-sequences-and-recursive-structure&quot;&gt;Fancy math: Farey sequences and recursive structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math so far is pretty familiar to physicists – we’re used to thinking about lattices and lattice vectors, having seen them a hundred times in quantum courses.
As I’ve looked out at scenes like this, the thing I really wanted to understand is: &lt;em&gt;why does it look so fractal?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me try to be more precise: the little triangles of open “aisles” in our field photograph sure give the impression of a sort of recursive structure – given two big triangles, one usually finds a medium triangle between them, and there are never two big triangles too close to each other, sort of like a compass rose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/compass_rose.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It very much looks to me like, if you started adding triangular regions in order of decreasing size, you’d tend to insert each new triangle closer than chance to the midpoint of its neighbors.
I actually simulated this and it’s not true – to my surprise the distribution appears to be uniform – but in my trying to understand this I did come across some cool math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence&quot;&gt;Farey sequences&lt;/a&gt; are sequences of rational fractions defined in the following manner:
the Farey sequence of order \(n\) consists of all unique rational numbers in \([0,1]\) with denominator less than or equal to \(n\).
This actually maps nicely onto our problem restricted such that \(b \ge a \ge 0\), in which case the valid \(\frac{a}{b}\) are exactly the rational numbers in \([0, 1]\).
The Farey sequences have many weird properties, one of which is the following: if \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{c}{d}\) are neighbors in a Farey sequence, then as you increase \(n\), the first element to appear between them is always \(\frac{a + c}{b + d}\).
In our problem, that means that if there are open directions at \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\) and no bigger open direction between them, then the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; open direction between them will lie at \((a + c, b + d)\)!
For example, the biggest open direction between \((0,1)\) and \((1,0)\) is \((1,1)\), and the biggest open direction between Farey-neighbors \((3,5)\) and \((2,3)\) is \((5, 8)\).
The wiki page for the Farey sequences has all sorts of interesting recursive diagrams that fall out of this recursive structure.
(Sidebar: as of writing, I don’t understand why this property is true. I’d be happy to have someone explain it to me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this tell us about the visual effect one sees when looking out at a regularly-planted field?
Well, it means that, when adding the next-biggest open region between two existing regions, it’ll tend to be placed closer to the &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; of the two existing regions.
Looking back at our field photograph (esp the version annotated with arrows), this is certainly the case!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-apparent-openness-vs-angle-be-described-by-a-smooth-function&quot;&gt;Can “apparent openness” vs. angle be described by a smooth function?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number theory is very beautiful, but essentially discrete in nature.
The special directions we find are pointlike: look in one &lt;em&gt;particular direction&lt;/em&gt; and you’ll see forever, but a little bit to either side and you won’t.
However, when I look out at a cropfield like this – particularly at the gif – my eye isn’t just drawn to certain points: a bigger region leading up to the point at infinity pops out to me visually.
This makes sense – in the idealized setting, if I look slightly off an infinite-sight direction, I’ll still see pretty far!
This makes me want some kind of &lt;em&gt;continuous&lt;/em&gt; function of angle that tells me, say, how far I’ll typically see when looking in that direction.
Perhaps this function is parameterized by some notion of tree diameter \(d\), and has peaks that appear at the rational angles as \(d\) decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll say upfront that I tried for a while and didn’t come up with anything nice.
This is the open question: can one write down a nice analytical function of angle that in some sense captures “how far” one can see along angle \(\theta\) through a forest of regularly-spaced trees of diameter \(d\)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do have is a hacky numerical experiment and some cool plots.
I’ll use a proxy metric I can compute in Python: with trees of diameter \(d\), what’s the farthest one could possibly see in direction \(\theta\) if one stood in the optimal place?
Well, actually, I’ll use a metric that’s almost the same (in particular being infinite in the same places) but easier to compute: with pointlike trees, what’s the longest rectangle of width \(d\) that one can fit anywhere in the lattice with long side at angle \(\theta\) from an axis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a gif of the result.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:b&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:b&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/croprows/openness_plots.gif&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of cool stuff to see in this!
Most obviously, you can see the lattice directions opening up in the predicted sequence: the cardinal directions (\((1,0)\) etc.) are open at the start, and then the \((1,1)\) direction and friends open up when \(d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), and then the \((1,2)\) directions and friends open up, and so on.
Interestingly, a direction is always a local minimum just before it opens up – when \(d\) is just larger than \(w_{a,b}\), changing angle just a little bit in either direction will let you “see” one tree further.
This is a neat one to try to understand by playing with a diagram yourself.
There also seem to be no local maxima that aren’t vertical asymptotes.
These properties give the process a sort of fractally feel: concave-up regions between vertical asymptotes get recursively split in two by new asymptotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is cool and all – it’s a parameterized function which gains vertical asymptotes corresponding to all the rational numbers as the parameter decreases! – but I still want a nice analytical version of this.
If you have any ideas, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:f&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m actually quite impressed that these plants are spaced regularly enough over such a large area to give such regular patterns! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:f&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:q&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By this, we mean to disallow vectors like \((4, 6)\) and \((2, 0)\) where either (a) the elements are not coprime or (b) zero is paired with an integer not equal to one. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:q&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:a&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Noise in the placement of trees has essentially the same effect as nonzero tree width. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:a&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:b&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that I’m changing the size of the trees in this animation here even though it’s really the width of an imaginary rectangle that’s changing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:b&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Favorite quotes from &lt;em&gt;Letters to a Young Poet&lt;/em&gt;</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
blockquote {
    border-left: 4px solid #ccc;  /* Adds a left border to the block quote */
    margin: 1em 10px;             /* Adds margin for better spacing */

    background-color: #f9f9f9;    /* Sets a light background for visibility */
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainier Maria Rilke’s &lt;em&gt;Letters to a Young Poet&lt;/em&gt; is a short and singular book, consisting of a sequence of ten letters written by the famous poet and novelist to an aspiring young poet who initiated their correspondence in search of advice in poetry. Rilke’s letters are remarkable for their candor and sincerity and depth of feeling: Rilke’s advice extends beyond the question of how to compose literature to the question of how to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this collection at a time in which I’m trying to work out how best to express some artistic tendencies of mine, and it was useful to hear Rilke’s thoughts on authentic living and artistic authenticity. Here are some of my favorite quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On living questions without knowing the answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are so young, so before all beginning, and I want to beg you, as much as I can. dear sir, to be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On solitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The necessary thing is after all but this: solitude, great inner solitude. Going into oneself and for hours meeting no one – this one must be able to attain. To be solitary, the way one was solitary as a child, when the grownups went around involved with things that seemed important and big because they themselves looked so busy and because one comprehended nothing of their doings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Rilke’s own inner sadness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if there is one thing more that I must say to you, it is this: Do not believe that he who seeks to comfort you lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life has much difficulty and sadness and remains far behind yours. Were it otherwise he would never have been able to find those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On working in traditional genres:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Avoid at first those forms that are too facile and commonplace: they are the most difficult, for it takes a great, fully matured power to give something of your own where good and even excellent traditions come to mind in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one’s relationship with one’s skeptical parents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ask no advice from them and count upon no understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance and trust that in this love there is a strength and a blessing, out beyond which you do not have to step in order to go very far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On whether one should write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You ask whether your verses are good. You ask me. You have asked others before. You send them to magazines. You compare them with other poems, and you are disturbed when certain editors reject your efforts. Now (since you have allowed me to advise you) I beg you to give up all that. You are looking outward, and that above all you should not do now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nobody can counsel and help you, nobody. Search for the reason that bids you write; find out whether it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places of your heart, acknowledge to yourself whether you would have to die if it were denied you to write. This above all—ask yourself in the stillest hour of your night: must I write? Delve into yourself for a deep answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And if this should be affirmative, if you may meet this earnest question with a strong and simple, “I must,” then build your life according to this necessity; your life even into its most indifferent and slightest hour must be a sign of this urge and a testimony to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>How many babies were born during the 2024 eclipse?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was privileged enough to see the 2024 total eclipse. I watched it in a clearing in dry west Texas, surrounded by awed humans, most of whom, like me, had roadtripped from far away for the glorious event. The trip deserves its own post, but for the meantime, here’s a short little calculational anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after totality, while discussing the number of marriages during the eclipse, someone wondered: how many babies were born during totality? It’s an interesting question because, unlike weddings, you mostly can’t control it, but any baby born during totality will have an amazing story for their entire life. Another guy and I decided to try to estimate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll restrict our focus to babies born in the US. I’ll give two solutions: first, the rough estimate we did in the field without looking up any numbers, and second, a more refined estimate using real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rough-estimate&quot;&gt;Rough estimate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We essentially want two numbers for the US: $\text{[births per unit (area} \times \text{time)]}$ and $\text{[total eclipse (area} \times \text{time)]}$. We can then multiply these numbers to get an expected total number of births.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we estimate the area of the US by approximating it as a giant rectangle:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[contiguous US area]} \approx 3000 \times 1000 \ \text{mi}^2 = 3 \times 10^6 \ \text{mi}^2\]

&lt;p&gt;Then we the estimate the US birth rate by imagining that its entire population refreshes every 100 years:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[US birth rate]} \approx \frac{\text{[US population]}}{\text{[human lifespan]}} \approx \frac{3 \times 10^8 \ \text{people}}{100 \ \text{years}} = 3 \times 10^6 \ \frac{\text{people}}{\text{year}}\]

&lt;p&gt;We estimate the eclipse path size as a long thin rectangle whose dimensions we’re guessing from memory:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[eclipse path size]} \approx 1000 \times 50 \ \text{mi}^2 = 5 \times 10^4 \ \text{mi}^2\]

&lt;p&gt;And we use a number for the duration of totality:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[eclipse duration]} \approx 10 \ \text{min}\]

&lt;p&gt;Finally, combining everything and approximating $\text{1 year} \approx 5 \times 10^5 \ \text{min}$, we find that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{[number of eclipse births]} &amp;amp;\approx \frac{\text{[US birth rate]}}{\text{[contiguous US area]}} \times \text{[eclipse path size]} \times \text{[eclipse duration]} \\
&amp;amp;\approx \frac{3 \times 10^6 \ \text{people / year} \times 5 \times 10^4 \ \text{mi}^2 \times 10 \ \text{min}}{3 \times 10^6 \ \text{mi}^2} \\
&amp;amp;\approx 1 \ \text{person} \ (!!)
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, everything cancels, and we’re left with a prediction of, on average, &lt;em&gt;one baby born during totality in the United States!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;refined-estimate&quot;&gt;Refined estimate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s see how close our feeder quantities were to the real numbers. Standard references (Wikipedia, the CDC, etc.) tell us that, in reality,&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[contiguous US area]} \approx 3.1 \times 10^6 \ \text{mi}^2\]

\[\text{[US birth rate]} \approx  3.7 \times 10^6 \ \frac{\text{people}}{\text{year}}\]

&lt;p&gt;Looking an actual eclipse map, a better estimate for the size of the path of totality seems like&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[eclipse path size]} \approx 2100 \times 110 \ \text{mi}^2 = 2.31 \times 10^5 \ \text{mi}^2\]

&lt;p&gt;While it’s all over the internet that the duration of totality on the centerline of the path was about four minutes, I didn’t readily find any maps that show how that duration falls off as you get closer to the edge of the path. However, the fact that nobody seemed to worry much about being near the centerline suggests that the duration doesn’t fall off too fast — probably slower than linear! Working through the geometry of one circle translating and occluding a second, slightly smaller circle, it seems to me like a plot of duration vs. position traces a semicircle — that is, $\text{[duration]} \propto \sqrt{\text{[path half-width]}^2 - \text{[distance from centerline]}^2}$:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:q&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:q&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/eclipse_baby/eclipse_duration_plot.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Since the plot here has a steep slope near its edges, you'll get close to maximum duration even if you're close to the edge of the path. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the upshot is that, actually, we can just take four minutes as the eclipse duration across the whole path and be mostly correct, and if we want to be more precise, we can average over the path width, which amounts to multiplying by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{4}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, we get&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
\text{[number of eclipse births]} &amp;amp;\approx \frac{3.7 \times 10^6 \ \text{people / year} \times 2.31 \times 10^5 \ \text{mi}^2 \times 4 \times \frac{\pi}{4} \ \text{min}}{3.1 \times 10^6 \ \text{mi}^2} \\
&amp;amp;\approx 1.6 \ \text{person}
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;So, in light of this better calculation, how’d the rough estimate turn out? Surprisingly, our field estimates of the area and birth rate of the US were really good, and we underestimated the area of the eclipse but overestimated its duration in ways that came close to cancelling, so our refined estimate is just a bit bigger than our original estimate! It always surprises me how often these rough Fermi estimates are quite close to better calculations… I’d be really interested in a paper studying how errors usually accumulate in Fermi calculations to get some intuition for when to expect an accurate result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-was-there-actually-an-eclipse-baby&quot;&gt;So was there actually an eclipse baby?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling thing related to “eclipse baby” returns &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/mom-welcomes-baby-named-sol-total-solar-eclipse/story?id=109038075&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; of a Texas family whose baby was born on the eclipse day. This article says that it was born during the total eclipse, but the birth time they give is about half an hour before totality, and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/watch/play-710fe6a0f001782&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; the parents say they saw the total eclipse after the birth, so it seems this is just a near miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question’s still out, then — was there a baby born during totality in 2024? I If you meet this baby, please introduce us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roadtripping to North Dakota</title>
        <description>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/hover_effects.css&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I did a solo roadtrip, spending two weeks driving a curving path from Nashville, TN to Bismarck, ND to go to every state I’d never been to. This was a deeply satisfying and rewarding experience – I got to drink deeply of solitude and nature and freedom, got to practice living on the road, and hit 50 states just before my father and brother, who were at 48 and 49 respectively and didn’t know I was doing this. Here I’ll sketch my journey and conclude with a few things I’m taking away from this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-route&quot;&gt;The route&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had eight states to knock off: Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and North Dakota. I’d been picking off stragglers for years, leaving myself a big mostly-contiguous chunk in the midwest ripe for a high-value roadtrip. I viewed this as a more extreme version of how, when playing Tetris, one tends to carefully preserve a vertical gap for a long piece and then knocks out four rows at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one fixed pin of this trip – and the reason I did it when I did – was an engagement party one weekend in Nashville, so I decided to plan a long layover in Atlanta on my way there and then drive everywhere else. The final route looks like a path you’d only travel if you were trying to drive through a very specific sequence of states:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:a&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:a&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/states_roadtrip/route_map.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-logistics&quot;&gt;Some logistics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived out of a 2024 Hyundai Elantra for these two weeks. I’d actually rented the cheapest car available, but when I got to the lot, the rental agent told me he “wouldn’t do me dirty like that” and instead gave me a stupidly nice brand new car that, thanks to automated lanekeeping, basically drives itself on the highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed in a few Airbnbs and a motel, but I greatly preferred my nights in the woods. As it turns out, dispersed camping is allowed in national forests (which are nicely visualized on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/ivm/&quot;&gt;this wonderful map&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s somehow quite freeing to drive into a big wild forest and get to camp basically anywhere, picking an arbitrary dirt road and pitching camp too deep in the woods to be likely to see another soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out from Nashville on the morning of March 17th. I’ll flash some scenes from the trip. Mouse over the photos for vignettes!&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In Atlanta, I took public transit into the city and rested in Centennial Park. The air was warm. I chatted briefly with a few homeless folks but mostly kept to myself.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;hover-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;To check off Kentucky, I went to Mammoth Caves with a friend of friends from the engagement party. He turned out to be a mathematician, and we knocked some math puzzles back and forth as we walked around the largest cave in the world.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This ridiculous Bass Pro Shops pyramid stands in Memphis. Like the greater pyramids of Egypt, this structure sports four triangular sides, various anti-robbery mechanisms, and an assortment of dead animals, and is similarly anthropologically fascinating. Instead of mummies, however, this modern pyramid only contains old people.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;hover-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Ironically, I found myself unintentionally on the path of totality of the 2024 solar eclipse just a few weeks too early, and I’d drive far away and then do a whole second roadtrip back to the path from California.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Kansas was expansive, calm, and flat. As I drove north from Arkanasas, I could see the land change, quickly turning from rocky forested hills to flat Southern forest to open plains, all in the span of an hour or two.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;This Kansas town had a classic middle-America look that'd seem at home in the 1950's to me. I slept in Kansas City, Missouri that evening.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I stayed a few days with Matthew Schallenkamp, a friend and coworker, in Sioux Falls, SD, working on a coding project and seeing the town. Remarkably for a city of a quarter million people, Sioux Falls has a huge set of rapids rolling through the middle of town.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Matthew joined me on a trip west to Devils Tower. What a weird formation.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;In Nashville, I athletically somersaulted onto a mechanical bull.&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I spent two nights in the Arkansas Ozarks. It’s beautiful hill country.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Nebraska allegedly has some cool buttes and bluffs off on its western side (actually, all the plains states seem to get cooler as you go west), but I skirted its eastern border, following the Missouri River and camping on the shore.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I love the Badlands. They’re so cool. I hadn’t been since I was a child, and I hadn’t remembered that these wonderful formations are just dirt, not rock. They’re so fragile — one determined person with a shovel could probably really change the view! In line with this, it’s a pretty geologically young place, with erosion starting only some 500k years ago.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I sent this picture to my brother and father after I told them I had some news. Yes, they were mad, and it was great.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;col-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-lessons&quot;&gt;Some lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip afforded me ample time for reflection and coincided with a more extended personal journey I’ve been on for the past year in which I’ve been figuring out how to live as an adult in ways feel good. I learned a number of things about roadtripping, including that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it’s very useful to run a tight ship logistically, taking care of problems as soon as they arise and keeping gear quite organized. I never had any major logistical problems, which is unusual for me, and it’s because I gave problems my attention when they were still small.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talking to strangers is a great joy of travel, and a good way to quickly get the feel of a place. Unplanned conversations were highlights of the trip. (See &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/why-i-talk-to-strangers/&quot;&gt;Why I Talk To Strangers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driving on snow is way harder than I expected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The land is big, but it’s fathomably big. Taking a plane from coast to coast gives little sense of how much land there is since you really have no physical feeling of how fast you’re traveling. Driving across the heartlands gave me a real sense of how big the land is: if I drive for an hour or two or three, the character of the land will differ – hills turn to forest, forest turns to grassland, grassland to plains, to prairie, to badlands – and if I go for ten or twenty of these changes I’ll go from one side of the country to the other. America feels like a much more tangible thing to me now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, even more valuable, some broader life lessons and realizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A career has to be fun to be fulfilling. No matter how important I feel science is, and how convinced I am that I could make a valuable contribution, it’s not worth doing if it’s not fun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various realizations about software engineering thanks to Matthew, including that it’s a skill I simply don’t have but could develop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m kinda lonely! This particularly solitary endeavor clarified for me that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my endeavors are actually solitary, and I want more collaboration and closeness with the people around me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nature is good medicine, and I need more of it in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is the route I actually followed, not the route I’d planned, which was more stripped down, going north from Sioux Falls to Fargo to finish. I added on the big excursion to go see nature in the western Dakotas halfway through, which turned out to be a great idea. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:a&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
