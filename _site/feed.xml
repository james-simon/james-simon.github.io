        <title>The Ballad of the Crane Breeder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My brother’s girlfriend’s dad, Tom Zimmer, had the craziest job out of high school I’ve ever heard of.
He shipped up to a wildlife preserve in Wisconsin and there found his job was to &lt;em&gt;artificially inseminate cranes.&lt;/em&gt;
They wouldn’t breed in captivity, so he had to go to their pens — the male first, then the female — to collect and deposit the necessary genetic material.
One hitch: they’re such violent birds (especially the males) that they’ll peck the hell out of you before you can get the goods, so he’d cover the backs of his calves with cardboard for armor, catch them between his legs when they ran at him, and do what he came to do.
This is apparently a legitimate technique in crane husbandry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a man with a story like that is in desperate need of a songwriter, and I decided I fit the bill.
Please enjoy my rendition of the teenage occupation of one Tom Zimmer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reharmonizing Ode to Joy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it beautiful and fascinating how a melody can be changed or enhanced by an artistic choice of the underlying chords. As a study in chord choice, I spent an afternoon reharmonizing Ode to Joy. Here’s my finished product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s really short, this was a lot of fun to work on. It was really satisfying to see how adding sevenths to chords made the progression feel jazzier, and how throwing in unusual chords like major thirds and sixths made it feel more tangy and colorful, and how bringing it back to the tonic at the end makes it feel like you’ve wandered afield and come back home. I really had no feel for chord progressions before starting to teach myself music theory some two years ago, but playing around with different ideas and listening very closely to the results in this and known songs and a lot of improvisation has really helped. It’s wonderful to see that there are deeper ideas in music besides the notes, behind the notes, and the structure there is really magical to see and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Wedding March (Muppets version)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two friends asked me to play Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer Night’s Dream&lt;/em&gt; at their ceremony. After a day learning the piece and a few hours in GarageBand, I sent them this and told them they’d be getting the Muppets version.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On the scientific method and its application to the science of deep learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently found myself involved in many discussions centered on the question of how we might develop a satisfactory science of modern machine learning. It certainly seems likely that such a science should be possible, as every important human feat of engineering has eventually admitted an explanatory science. Given such a science, engineering artifacts are revealed as points in a space of viable constructions: with an understanding of mechanics and materials science, we see the Taj Mahal and the Colosseum are two points in the space of stable freestanding structures made of stone, and we can describe the boundaries of this set. It is of course one of the great scientific questions of our time whether current foundation models and their inevitable successors may be located within such a scientific framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is widespread support for work developing the “science of deep learning,” there is little consensus as to what this science will look like or what constitutes meaningful progress. Much of this disarray is of course inevitable and healthy: deep learning is complex, complementary approaches will be necessary, and we do not know what, exactly, we are looking for. Much of the confusion, however, is evitable and unhelpful: even when searching for an unknown object, it helps to search methodically. This essay is a discussion of the method of search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to me that the present disorder lies mostly downstream from confusion about some basic questions: what is science, and how do you do it? Actually, we don’t care about science merely because it is Science, but rather because it is a technique we may use, so what we are really asking is: how do you make useful sense of something mysterious in the world, and when the mystery is great, how do you go about making progress anyways? While these questions are basic, they are by no means easy. I would like to share some thoughts on these questions informed by my experience and my own process of trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many great thinkers of the last century have offered insightful discussions of the scientific mindset and process, and I strongly recommend sitting down with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability&quot;&gt;Popper’s notion of falsifiability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Kuhn-SSR-2ndEd.pdf&quot;&gt;Kuhn’s depiction of the scientific process&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feynman.com/science/what-is-science/&quot;&gt;Feynman’s joyful empiricism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/w/original-sequences&quot;&gt;Yudkowsky’s techniques for clear thinking&lt;/a&gt;. All have greatly shaped my own views, and I have little to say about the general process of science that one of them has not already said better. I would like to contribute just one idea concerning the so-called scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn in grade school that the process of science follows a defined sequence of steps: observation, hypothesis, experiment (with at least three trials), analysis of data, and acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis. However, any practicing scientist knows that this is not really how science works. The anatomy of a scientific project usually bears little resemblance to this tidy storybook picture.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Useful projects take such a great diversity of forms that it can seem like anything at all goes. One might then fairly wonder: are there, after all, any truly essential steps, or is one approach as good as another? This is an important question for any field that hopes to make material progress towards understanding a great mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that, yes, there are two essential steps to the scientific method. Step A is to figure something out. Step B is to check and make sure you’re not wrong. You can do these steps in any order, but you have to do them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/scientific_method/scientific_method.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; The scientific method.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the good science I know does both of these steps. If you only do the first step — figuring something out but not adequately checking that you’re right — you’re doing philosophy, or theology, or another speculative practice. Such speculation can be beautiful and useful, but at the end of the day, it can rarely be built upon. If you only do the second thing — performing an empirical check but not figuring anything out — you’re usually doing engineering.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules whatsoever as to how you do the first step. You are allowed to figure things out via educated guess, long experience, mathematical derivation, meditation, or divine inspiration. This is often where the ingenuity of the theorist enters into play. There is only one rule with the second step: you have to do a &lt;em&gt;good job&lt;/em&gt; checking you’re not wrong, ideally good enough to convince other people. This, too, can be done in many different ways — direct experiment, elimination of alternatives, checking new predictions — but it is absolutely essential that it is done adequately. It can be very difficult to do this well, or even to figure out how to do it! This is the nerve-wracking step where one makes sure that one isn’t fooling oneself. This is usually where the ingenuity of the experimentalist comes into play.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:a&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:a&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the poor science of which I am aware fails in one of these two steps. It is, of course, very common for a study to fail to adequately demonstrate its central claims: this is understandable, as true, interesting facts are quite difficult to find! On the other side, uninteresting, hypertechnical experiments (which have unfortunately become the norm in certain crowded areas of physics) perform their empirical checks just fine, but when the lab equipment is back in its boxes, it is unclear what general fact has been figured out. (Yep, our Rube Goldberg machine of diffraction gratings, modulators, cavities, and heavy atoms works as predicted! Anyone remember what it was all for?) I also see studies that claim to figure something out about a system of interest (e.g., deep learning), but which fail to state a specific enough conjecture to go and test it, which is a partial failure in both steps. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth clarifying that a scientist does not have to do both steps of the scientific method in every scientific paper. An individual contribution may be entirely the proposal of a new idea, as in Darwin’s book or most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Planck-1901/Planck-1901.html&quot;&gt;seminal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://uni-tuebingen.de/fileadmin/Uni_Tuebingen/Fakultaeten/MathePhysik/Institute/IAP/Forschung/MOettel/Geburt_QM/bohr_PhilMag_26_1_1913.pdf&quot;&gt;theoretical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01397280&quot;&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://uni-tuebingen.de/fileadmin/Uni_Tuebingen/Fakultaeten/MathePhysik/Institute/IAP/Forschung/MOettel/Geburt_QM/schrodinger_AnnPhys_386_109_1926.pdf&quot;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19053220806&quot;&gt;of the early 1900s&lt;/a&gt;, or it may consist entirely of measurements, as in Tycho Brahe’s meticulous observations of the planets or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2964-7&quot;&gt;careful modern measurements of fundamental physical constants&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite legitimate for a contribution to &lt;em&gt;dis&lt;/em&gt;prove an existing belief without offering a replacement. The important thing is that a scientist doing one or the other recognizes that they are part of a conversation with the other part: the person proposing the ideas expects other people to go and test them and so tries to make it easy for them to do so, and the people checking the ideas know what the implications are if the experiment comes out one way or the other. Every scientific contribution should understand itself as part of a project that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; do both steps of the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are both of these steps necessary for the progress of science? If a line of research does not purport to have figured out any general fact, it is unclear what has been learned or how to build on it. On the other hand, if it does not adequately check its claims, then until it does, it will carry a shadow of fundamental doubt that prevents others from productively building on it. Furthermore, and often more significantly in practice, the act of checking usually contains within it the act of application, as the most convincing way to check a claim is often to operationalize it to do something of interest. Science is an edifice that builds on itself. It usually consists of so many layers that each piece of brickwork must be quite solid to support future building, and each brick must be crafted with future bricks in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really believe me that the essential scientific method has only two steps, you might ask: what’s all this other mumbo jumbo about preregistered hypotheses, repeated trials, cognitive biases and what not? There are a few things going on. First off, while these two steps are simple, actually doing them is hard, so we have some established techniques that sometimes make them easier. Some of these help with the figuring out, but that’s mostly a dark art.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Most of these are techniques for the &lt;em&gt;checking&lt;/em&gt; of our knowledge: preregistered hypotheses, multiple trials, the inclusion of error bars, blind review, and most of the other rituals of science are &lt;em&gt;ways to do step B.&lt;/em&gt; None is essential, but they are useful techniques for checking our answer and avoiding fooling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, some of these techniques are field-specific. For example, in psychology, social science, and nutrition, it’s notoriously tempting to choose one’s hypothesis after seeing the data. In these fields, the space of hypotheses is usually large and the resolving power of evidence is usually weak, so choosing the most-supported claim post-hoc often amounts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging&quot;&gt;p-hacking&lt;/a&gt;, and preregistering hypotheses makes it more likely to not be totally wrong. In (non-string-theory) physics, the situation is usually the opposite — hypotheses are few and evidence is abundant — so preregistration isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps apply even in a nascent field that knows very little. While no method is sufficient to guarantee useful progress in the search, failure to do both steps all but guarantees no progress will be made. By way of analogy, when searching a large unfamiliar house for a desired object, one’s chances of success are greatly improved by a methodical search that progressively expands an explored volume. It is possible to learn that &lt;em&gt;it’s not in this cabinet,&lt;/em&gt; say, but only if one first identifies the cabinet as a useful unit of exploration, then does a sufficiently thorough search that the cabinet does not need to be revisited in the future. Failures &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; progress, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when they are sufficiently clear and careful so as to reassure other searchers that the space of possible truths is meaningfully reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the scientific method consists of two steps: you must figure something out, and you must adequately check that you are not mistaken. It seems to me that these are the two things we must demand of any useful scientific project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-recognize-the-scientific-method-in-the-science-of-deep-learning&quot;&gt;How to recognize the scientific method in the science of deep learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning presents a large number of important mysteries. What exactly we believe these mysteries &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; has evolved over time and will continue to do so, but all present agree that the mysteries are there. Certainly it seems that the practice of deep learning involves far more arbitrary choices and yields far more surprising results than it ought to if we knew better. There is thus probably much ground to gain. Because the success of deep learning is an empirical phenomenon and we wish to explain it, this is very much a scientific question, and we will be wise to consciously use the methods of science to structure our search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are gradually learning to do genuine science in the study of deep learning, and the rewards have been proportionate. However, a great deal of research effort ostensibly in service of our understanding of deep learning is expended in directions which are quite far from science and which consequently make little real progress. This is not a personal vendetta of mine: I have found this to be the consensus of virtually every researcher in the field with whom I have discussed the subject. In fact, this number includes many interviewees who have described their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; work to me as of this ineffectual type, usually with a palpable air of despondence! (By contrast, the deep learning researchers I know who have caught the “science bug” tend to be energized and optimistic.) We as a field are due for a serious discussion of our methods and search strategy, and we can be optimistic that effectual methods are quite achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we recognize the scientific method in the study of deep learning? We should look for work which (a) purports to figure out something particular and clear about deep learning, and (b) reports simple, convincing experiments that compellingly support it. The things figured out can really take any form so long as they are clearly stated and seem useful. They may be empirical (”A causes B”; “C phenomenon reliably happens”), mathematical (equations, limits, new mathematical objects), or even metascientific (e.g., “D is a useful proxy model for deep learning”). Qualitative claims are fine, but quantitative claims are best, because they may be verified with great confidence and may usually be applied in a large number of cases. Qualitative claims are rarely verified reliably (and often fold under later scrutiny) because of the sheer number of possible causes in a system as complex as deep learning. In assessing the progress of deep learning, we should count the number of interesting, easily verifiable quantitative claims one can make about deep learning systems, and individual researchers should seek to add to this count. This is how we will mark our progress in our search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does most “science of deep learning” work do on this minimal rubric of scientific method? By way of illustration, let me run through some of the major research trends in the last five years of deep learning theory. I will start with some failings before ending with some victories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On formality and rigor to the detriment of insight.&lt;/strong&gt; It is an item of little controversy (at least when discussing off the record) that a great number of deep learning theory papers are impressively rigorous and mathematically complex, but ultimately shed little to no light on the mystery originally motivating the endeavor. Papers of this sort tend to share certain features: asymptotic notation obscures large hidden constants; theorem statements require significant parsing in order to extract the essence of the result; the problem setup introduces complexity for the sake of a more impressive result rather than simplifying the setup for clarity and insight; few or no experiments are reported, and certainly none with nonlinear networks. Any seasoned deep learning theorist has read numerous such papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this pattern is the result of mistaking the scientific study of deep learning for a discipline of mathematics, which then requires formality and rigor. It emphatically is not: we are faced here with great and glaring empirical mysteries, and experiments are cheap and easy.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seems virtually guaranteed that we will first understand deep learning through quick-and-dirty nonrigorous arguments which may later be formalized, as a path through the woods is first blazed and then only later paved over in asphalt. Formality and rigor are a hindrance if they make it harder to understand the real nature of what you have figured out. As the saying goes, all theorems are true, but only some are interesting, and taking stock of the present state of our knowledge, it is greatly preferable to have an interesting nonrigorous result than an uninteresting theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papers of this mathematical sort rarely include experiments: sometimes there are experiments tacked on at the end, but they are usually an afterthought. If the study of deep learning were mathematics, this would be understandable, as a proven theorem requires no empirical demonstration. Because the study of deep learning is a science, however, neglecting experiments is utter folly. Unless the proven theorem totally resolves an important question in a completely realistic setting, experiments can extend a result’s scope of applicability, show its limits, check assumptions, or simply make it easier to understand the stated claim. If our goal is to understand deep learning, it sure seems wise to check empirically whether whatever you suppose you have figured out &lt;em&gt;applies to deep learning!&lt;/em&gt; If it doesn’t, or the fit is worse than you expected, this merits explanation. If it does, then the contribution is all the greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overly mathematical nature of much deep learning theory research is natural and understandable given the field’s history: most workers come from TCS, statistics, or mathematics. Nonetheless, the game has changed, and we should require less rigor, more insight, and more empirics from contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress in the study of the dynamics of neural network training.&lt;/strong&gt; It seems to me that much of the lasting progress of the last five years — the stuff that’s really stuck around and been built on — is essentially all of a particular type which marries theory and empirics. This strain of research is characterized by several trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It demands satisfying equations and quantitative predictions, and it is willing to study very simple cases and study dumb-seeming quantities in order to make this happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the equations do not usually come &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; experiments, they are easily verified &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assumptions are checked empirically. Assumptions that are both good and useful are celebrated and kept around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is humble: it studies only what it can describe well, and does not make premature claims about downstream topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the work in this vein describes the &lt;em&gt;dynamics&lt;/em&gt; of neural network learning rather than the &lt;em&gt;performance,&lt;/em&gt; which is what I mean by humility. Some touchstone topics in this vein include the theories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6120&quot;&gt;deep linear networks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165&quot;&gt;NNGP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572&quot;&gt;neural tangent kernel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yang21c.html&quot;&gt;the maximal update parameterization&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00065&quot;&gt;edge of stability&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922&quot;&gt;generalization of kernel ridge regression&lt;/a&gt;, and the study of hyperparameter scaling relationships (see, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16620&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). All these ideas presented new mathematical quantities derived from model training which closely follow simple equations. All have proven solid enough to build further understanding on top of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This variety of deep learning theory does not yet have an accepted name. We should give it one. Because of its similarities to the physical sciences, the “physics of deep learning” is a candidate term, though this carries historical baggage, has already used to describe many things including &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13673&quot;&gt;other research directions&lt;/a&gt;, and risks alientating the mathematicians and statisticians who have contributed to this productive type of work and will do so in the future. “Analytical interpretability” may be a good term for this, conveying both the high bar of analytical results with the promise of interpreting the training process of deep learning. Plus, it abbreviates to “AI.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:b&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:b&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Since this line of work includes virtually all extant examples of quantitatively predictive theories for deep learning, I like to think of it as “experiment-dots-on-theory-curves” or “dots-on-curves” theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about empirical science?&lt;/strong&gt;
The above discussion is centered largely on deep learning theory. The science of deep learning is a rather greater endeavor, and has had some successes. Mechanistic interpretability cannot do what the physics of deep learning could (and vice versa; both are necessary), but it has been quite admirable as a scientific endeavor: it has made good use of the scientific method to coordinate a large-scale search over a difficult space. Deep learning theory should learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the even more empirical side, phenomena like adversarial examples and the lottery-ticket hypothesis were excellent empirical observations, though much of the followup work on these topics makes less use of the scientific method and has accreted into less lasting knowledge. The observation of scaling laws in neural network performance is perhaps the one extant example of a robust and important equation extracted purely from neural network empirics. This was an excellent observation, and it remains unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most “observations” in deep learning are of the type that “X method works for Y task.” Much fruitful dialog could be had between deep learning scientists and practitioners if the practitioners were more proactive in aggregating interesting phenomena and handing them to the scientists, and likewise if the scientists were more proactive in asking for them. Of course, most practitioners are too laser-focused on building AGI to care about theory, so I am dubious this will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Hail Maries.”&lt;/strong&gt;
Lastly, there have been a few ideas proffered of a type that I’ll call “hail Maries” after the long-bomb football pass.
These ideas try to take a big step forwards all in one step with a very good guess: they tend to be summarizable by statements of the form “hey, what if deep learning is actually just X?”
A good example of this is the much-embattled &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02406&quot;&gt;“information bottleneck” theory&lt;/a&gt;.
Even though the IB was conclusively disproven soon after its proposal, I strongly applaud the bold, testable hypothesis and honest attempt to figure something out.
Attempts to jump ahead in the story like this are likely to be wrong, but they are very much permitted in science.
Much of the development of quantum mechanics consisted of bold, unprecendent guesses!
Remember that there are no rules as to how one must figure something out: intuition-guided guesswork is quite allowed.
In our field, there are few ideas and much energy available to test them, so I would like to see more bold guesses of this type.
We should expect to see more such leaps as time goes on, and some of them will turn out to be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What now? We are making steady progress towards a theory of deep learning, a theory that we presumably hope to bend to the benefit of humankind. It has been over a decade since AlexNet, and we have tried much. Most of this has failed, but some of it has succeeded. It is a good time now to step back, notice the patterns in our successes, reassess our strategies, and seriously refocus our effort. Let’s get moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To list some deviations I have seen firsthand: sometimes the hypothesis changes dramatically, or only becomes clear at the end, or is absent altogether. Sometimes a single trial suffices, and sometimes one needs millions. Sometimes the hypothesis and conclusions are obvious and the data gathering is the whole project. Sometimes the conclusion has little to do with the initial aims of the project. I have seen very few scientific projects follow the script of the “science fair scientific method,” and these few usually turned out poorly! For example, I’ve rarely seen an interesting hypothesis confirmed by experiment when the scientists weren’t already damn near sure it was going to be true. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, the creator of any engineered artifact can rightly claim to have “figured out” that such an artifact is possible. Sometimes this is quite an interesting discovery! The boundaries between engineering and science are not clear, and we do not need them to be. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:a&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If I were to add a third step, it would be convincing other people. The community is the ultimate judge of whether you have figured something out and whether your experiments show that it is not wrong. A colleague points out that this is similar to Dorothy Sayer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_the_Maker&quot;&gt;third step of the creative process&lt;/a&gt;: sharing your work with the world and thereby having an effect on other people. To me, peer review feels like an important part of the scientific process, but feels secondary to the scientific &lt;em&gt;method&lt;/em&gt; – even alone on a desert island, you could do science as I describe it here – and in any case, it’s not like anyone is making important scientific progress and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sharing it, so I feel comfortable omitting it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:a&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yudkowsky attempts to make this mysterious process more mechanical in some of the Sequences, but it’s still quite difficult to come up with hypotheses. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a very interesting question, perhaps worthy of discussion elsewhere, what the merits of rigor and formality are in an exploratory endeavor. Most obviously, a proven theorem is always correct and will not fail unexpectedly, so all else equal, a theorem is preferable to an equivalent nonrigorous claim. When, though, does the extra solidity justify the price in labor? It seems to me that rigor and formality are most useful when the class of objects one wishes to describe is very large and of unknown character, and bizarre or pathological cases are prevalent and important. For example, the space of groups is very large and diverse, and so without axioms to work from, we are lost. Similarly, real analysis requires formality because it turns out the set of all univariate functions on the reals is far stranger than expected, and we cannot rely on our intuitions. On the other hand, when one already has an intuitive feel for the set of objects one wishes to characterize, the guardrails of formality are not so necessary. It is for this reason that you need very little formal math to do physics. This is very much the case in which we find ourselves with deep learning. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:b&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hat tip to Alex Atanasov for coining the term. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:b&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Backsolving classical generalization bounds from the modern kernel regression eigenframework</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blogpost shows how to use the omniscient KRR eigenframework, which gives a closed-form expression for the test error of KRR in terms of task eigenstructure, to quickly recover a classical generalization bound. I’ve worked with the modern eigenframework a great deal, and this blogpost was the result of a calculation I thought was new but quickly resolved to a classical bound. Even though the old classical bounds have proven fairly useless in modern problems, I still found this interesting: the calculation here presented is a different (and fast) way to arrive at a classical result, and it was clarifying for me to see where the looseness of the classical result slips in in the course of various approximations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will take as starting point the KRR eigenframework derived in many recent papers. We will use the notation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922&quot;&gt;our KRR eigenpaper&lt;/a&gt; with little further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a target function $f_*(\cdot)$ and a kernel function $K(\cdot,\cdot)$. We know the target function’s RKHS norm $\lvert \! \lvert f_\ast \rvert \! \rvert_K$. We will perform KRR with $n$ samples from an arbitrary measure $\mu$, and we would like to obtain a bound on the test error at optimal ridge&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[test MSE]}|_{\delta = \delta_*} \equiv \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mu}[(f_*(x) - \hat{f}(x))^2].\]

&lt;p&gt;We know $\max_{x \sim \mu} K(x,x)$, where the max runs over the support of $\mu$, or at least we know an upper bound for this quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rewriting-known-quantities-in-the-kernel-eigensystem&quot;&gt;Rewriting known quantities in the kernel eigensystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists a kernel eigendecomposition $K(x,x’) = \sum_i \lambda_i \phi_i(x) \phi_i(x’)$ which is orthonormal w.r.t. $\mu$, though we will not need to assume that we can find it. There also exists a decomposition $f_*(x) = \sum_i v_i \phi_i(x)$, though we again do not assume we can find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It holds that&lt;/p&gt;

\[|\!| f_* |\!|_K^2 = \sum_i \frac{v_i^2}{\lambda_i}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is true regardless of the measure $\mu$ — see my note on measure-independent properties of kernel eigensystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-kernel-eigenframework&quot;&gt;Using the kernel eigenframework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective ridge $\kappa &amp;gt; 0$ is the unique positive solution to&lt;/p&gt;

\[n = \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i \ + \ \frac{\delta}{\kappa},\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\mathcal{L}_i := \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \kappa} \in [0,1]$ is the “learnability” of mode $i$. We will go head and choose $\delta$ such that $\sum_i \mathcal{L}_i = \frac{n}{2}$, which will later give us the best constant prefactor in our bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eigenframework states that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\text{[test MSE]} \approx \mathcal{E} := \frac{n}{n - \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i^2} \sum_i (1 - \mathcal{L}_i)^2 v_i^2.\]

&lt;p&gt;We may now note three useful bounds. First, we may bound the prefactor above as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{n}{n - \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i^2} \le \frac{n}{n - \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i} = 2,\]

&lt;p&gt;where in the last step we have applied our choice of $\delta$. Second, we may bound the sum as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\sum_i (1 - \mathcal{L}_i)^2 v_i^2 
\ \le \ \sum_i (1 - \mathcal{L}_i) v_i^2
\ = \ \sum_i \frac{v_i^2}{\lambda_i} \frac{\kappa \lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \kappa}
\ \le \ \kappa \cdot \sum_i \frac{v_i^2}{\lambda_i} \le \kappa \cdot |\!| f_* |\!|_K^2.\]

&lt;p&gt;Finally, noting that $\sum_i \frac{\lambda_i}{\kappa} \ge \sum_i \mathcal{L}_i = \frac{n}{2}$, we may bound the constant $\kappa$ as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\kappa &amp;lt; \frac{2}{n} \sum_i \lambda_i = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Tr}[K]}{n} = \frac{2 \cdot \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mu}[K(x,x)]}{n} \le \frac{2 \cdot \max_{x \sim \mu}K(x,x)}{n}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Putting the above four equations together (and also using the fact that the test MSE at optimal ridge will be less than or equal to the test MSE at our chosen ridge), we find that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\boxed{\mathcal{E}|_{\delta = \delta_*} \le \frac{4 \cdot \max_{x \sim \mu} K(x,x)}{n} \cdot |\!| f_* |\!|_K^2.}\]

&lt;p&gt;This looks like a classical generalization bound! It seems to me like this sort of classical bound often doesn’t have one canonical statement but instead gets written many different ways (which I suppose makes sense if your equation is a fairly loose bound that you could tighten up in some places and loosen in others), and I couldn’t find an exact statement of precisely this form anywhere, so I suppose I’m not actually sure this is equivalent to a classical result (though ChatGPT assures me it is), but it certainly looks like lots of classical bounds I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use the fact that $\lvert ! \lvert f_\ast \rvert ! \rvert_{L^2(\mu)}^2 = \sum_i v_i^2$, we can obtain the (to me more illuminating) result that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\mathcal{E}|_{\delta = \delta_*}}{\mathcal{E}|_{\delta \rightarrow \infty}} \le \frac{4 \cdot \max_{x \sim \mu} K(x,x)}{n} \cdot \frac{|\!| f_* |\!|_K^2}{|\!| f_* |\!|_{L^2(\mu)}^2}.\]

&lt;p&gt;That is, the ratio of test error with $n$ samples to the naive test error of the zero predictor is controlled by the ratio of the RKHS norm of the target function to the $L^2$ norm of the target function.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One kernel, many eigensystems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a technical note on a subtlety of kernel theory. Venture in at your own risk!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many problems in the theory of kernel methods begin with a positive semi-definite kernel function $K(\cdot, \cdot)$ and a probability measure $\mu$ and are solved by first finding the kernel eigenfunctions ${\phi_i}$ and nonnegative eigenvalues ${\lambda_i}$ such that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\ \ \ \qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad K(x,x') = \sum_i \lambda_i \, \phi_i(x) \, \phi_i(x') \qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad (1)\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\quad \ \ \ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mu}[\phi_i(x) \, \phi_j(x')] = \delta_{ij}. \qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\quad (2)\]

&lt;p&gt;Equation 1 gives the spectral decomposition of the kernel, and Equation 2 states that the eigenfunctions are orthonormal with respect to the measure $\mu$.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;Mercer’s Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, there always exists such a decomposition, though it will generally be different for different measures $\mu$. In fact, there are infinitely many unique decompositions of the form $K(x,x’) = \sum_i \psi_i(x) \, \psi_i(x’)$, but only one of them (up to relabeling and some other symmetries) is “eigen” for a particular measure $\mu$. It is somewhat intriguing to note that each such decomposition is still equally &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; no matter the measure (the first equation having no dependence on $\mu$).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that every measure $\mu$ corresponds to a unique eigendecomposition, it is worth asking the inverse question: which kernel decompositions are “eigen” for some measure? That is, given a “candidate” eigensystem ${(\lambda_i, \phi_i)}$ such that $K(x,x’) = \sum_i \lambda_i \, \phi_i(x) \, \phi_i(x’)$, when does there exist a measure $\mu$ such that $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mu}[\phi_i(x) \, \phi_j(x’)] = \delta_{ij}$, and can we find the measure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-rightarrow-vector-language&quot;&gt;Functional $\rightarrow$ vector language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we will find it helpful to first move from a continuous setting to a discrete setting, as we may then forgo functional analysis for the simpler language of linear algebra. Let us suppose our measure has support only over $n$ discrete points ${x_i}_{i=1}^n$, and let us construct the kernel matrix $[\mathbf{K}]_{ij} = K(x_i, x_j)$, measure matrix $\mathbf{M} = \mathrm{diag}(\mu(x_1), \ldots, \mu(x_n))$, and candidate eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_i = (\phi_i(x_1), \ldots, \phi_i(x_n))$. In this linear algebraic language, we begin with the assurance that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{K} = \sum_i \lambda_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{v}_i^\top.\]

&lt;p&gt;We would like to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on ${\lambda_i, \mathbf{v}_i}$ such that there exists a positive-definite&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; diagonal $\mathbf{M}$ such that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{v}_i^{\top} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{v}_j = \delta_{ij}\]

&lt;p&gt;and $\mathrm{Tr}[\mathbf{M}] = 1$.
We begin by stacking our candidate vectors into a matrix $\mathbf{V} := (\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n)$ and likewise defining $\boldsymbol{\Lambda} := \mathrm{diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$. Note that all the matrices we have defined are invertible. We now have that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{V \Lambda V^\top}, \qquad \mathbf{V^\top M V} = \mathbf{I}.\]

&lt;p&gt;From the latter equation, we get that $\mathbf{M V V^\top} = \mathbf{I}$, and thus $\mathbf{K M V V^\top} = \mathbf{V \Lambda V^\top}$, and thus we obtain the eigenequation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{K M V} = \mathbf{V \Lambda}.\]

&lt;p&gt;We now find that $\mathbf{M V} = \mathbf{K}^{-1}\mathbf{V \Lambda}$, and thus that $\mathbf{M v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_i$ for each eigenindex $i$. We are now in a position to make several observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, since $\mathbf{v}^\top_i \mathbf{M v}_j = \lambda_i \mathbf{v}^\top_i \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_j = \delta_{ij}$, we find the requirement on our candidate eigensystem that $\lambda_i = \left( \mathbf{v}^\top_i \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_i \right)^{-1}$. This is best viewed as a normalization condition on the eigenvector: it is required that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\boxed{

|\!| \mathbf{v}_i |\!| = \left( \lambda_i \hat{\mathbf{v}}_i^\top \mathbf{K}^{-1} \hat{\mathbf{v}}_i  \right)^{-1/2}

}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Second, since $\mathbf{M}$ is positive and diagonal, we find that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{M v}_i = \mathbf{\mu} \circ \mathbf{v}_i = \lambda_i \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_i\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\circ$ denotes elementwise multiplication of vectors. Therefore a single candidate eigenpair $(\lambda_1, \mathbf{v}_1)$ is potentially valid only if there exists a positive vector $\mathbf{\mu}$ verifying the above equation — that is, if&lt;/p&gt;

\[\boxed{
m_{ik} := \frac{\lambda_i (\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_i)[k]}{\mathbf{v}_i[k]} &amp;gt; 0
\qquad \text{if} \ \  \mathbf{v}_i[k] \neq 0,}\]

&lt;p&gt;where we write $\mathbf{u}[k]$ denote the $k$-th element of a vector. We must additionally have that the different eigenvectors verify the same measure — that is,&lt;/p&gt;

\[\boxed{
m_{ik} = m_{ik'} := \mu_i
\qquad
\forall
\ \
k, k'
}\]

&lt;p&gt;except where one of the two is undefined. Finally, we must have that the measure we obtain is normalized:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\boxed{
\sum_i
\mu_i = 1.
}\]

&lt;p&gt;Together, the boxed equations are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive measure $\mathbf{\mu}$ such that ${(\lambda_i, \mathbf{v}_i)}$ indeed comprise an orthogonal eigenbasis with respect to $\mathbf{\mu}$. Interestingly, it follows from the above with no additional requirements that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{v}_i^\top \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_j = 0 \qquad \mathrm{if} \ i \neq j.\]

&lt;p&gt;That is, orthogonality with respect to the measure implies orthogonality with respect to $\mathbf{K}^{-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-functional-language&quot;&gt;Back to functional language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To phrase these results in functional language, we need to define the &lt;em&gt;inverse kernel operator.&lt;/em&gt; Define the kernel operator $T_K[g](\cdot) = \int K(\cdot, x) g(x) dx$. Let us assume this operator is invertible and construct the inverse $T^{-1}_K$.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In functional language, we require that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{\lambda_i \, T_K^{-1} [\phi_i](x)}{\phi_i(x)} = \frac{\lambda_j \, T_K^{-1} [\phi_j](x)}{\phi_j(x)} &amp;gt; 0
\qquad \forall \ i, j, x,\]

&lt;p&gt;except when either ratio is $\frac{0}{0}$. When this condition holds, the equated quantity is then equal to the measure $\mu(x)$ w.r.t. which ${\phi_i}$ are orthogonal.
Again, a single candidate eigenfunction $\phi_i$ determines the whole measure $\mu$ except where $\phi_i(x) = 0$.
We also of course require that the measure we find from the above is normalized when integrated over the full domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also find the (somewhat more inscrutable to me) condition that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\lambda_i = \left(\int \phi_i(x) \, T_K^{-1} [\phi_i](x) dx\right)^{-1},\]

&lt;p&gt;which again may be treated as a normalization condition on the eigenfunctions \(\phi_i\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connection-to-the-rkhs-inner-product&quot;&gt;Connection to the RKHS inner product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) inner product is given by&lt;/p&gt;

\[\langle g, h \rangle_K := \int g(x) \, T_K^{-1}[h](x) dx.\]

&lt;p&gt;In our vectorized setting we found that $\mathbf{v}_i^\top \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{v}_j = 0$ when $i \neq j$, and so we find in the functional setting that &lt;em&gt;for any kernel eigenfunctions w.r.t. any measure, it will hold that&lt;/em&gt; $\langle \phi_i, \phi_j \rangle_K = 0$ when $i \neq j$. That is, no matter which measure you choose, the eigenfunctions which diagonalize the kernel operator will be orthogonal w.r.t. the RKHS. This is remarkable because the RKHS norm does not depend at all on the measure which was chosen! I tend to avoid using RKHSs whenever possible, but this is a nice property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Astute readers might wonder why we do not also need to take as input the ”eigenequation” that $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mu}[K(x, x’) \, \phi_j(x’)] = \lambda_i \, \phi_i(x).$ Somewhat surprisingly (to me), this can actually be deduced from Equations 1 and 2, as we will discuss after vectorizing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since we have assumed that all eigenvalues are nonnegative, we are assured that $\mathbf{M}$ will be positive &lt;em&gt;definite&lt;/em&gt; instead of merely PSD. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This manipulation answers the question raised by Footnote 1: even with a nontrivial measure, the “right eigenequation” follows from the “kernel-compositional” and “measure-orthogonal” equations. We can in fact obtain any one of these equations from the other two. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To gain some intuition for these operators, note that if $K(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a Gaussian kernel, then $T_K$ performs Gaussian smoothing, while $T_K^{-1}$ performs “unsmoothing.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>A complete characterization of the expressivity of shallow, bias-free ReLU networks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the theoretical study of neural networks, one of the simplest questions one can ask is that of &lt;em&gt;expressivity.&lt;/em&gt; A neural network $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\cdot)$ can represent (or “express”) many different functions, and which function is expressed is determined by the choice of the parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. The study of expressivity simply asks: which class of functions may be represented?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the pantheon of ML algorithms, neural networks are famous for their high expressivity. This fact is requisite to their power and versatility: practitioners find that a big enough neural network can represent functions complicated enough generate language and images.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You may have heard of the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem&quot;&gt;universal approximation theorem&lt;/a&gt; which roughly states that an infinitely-wide neural network can represent &lt;em&gt;any function at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that nets’ expressivity is so high means that the notion of expressivity alone is usually unhelpful: it’s good to know that your network can represent virtually all functions, but this information is vacuous if you want to know which function it’ll actually learn! The one place where I’ve found the notion frequently useful is in negative cases: if a neural network architecture &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; express some class of function, it cannot learn it — no need for further questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blogpost is about one of those cases. The most common activation function used today is $\mathrm{ReLU}$, and so one would be forgiven for thinking that any big enough $\mathrm{ReLU}$ network will be able to express any function. It turns out this reasonable intuition is wrong: there are lots of functions that a shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ network with no biases can’t represent, even if it has infinite width. To spoil the answer, such a net can trivially only represent homogeneous functions (i.e., those such that $f(\alpha x) = \alpha \cdot f(x)$ for $\alpha &amp;gt; 0$), but less trivially, it also can’t represent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;odd polynomials of order greater than one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This fact’s independently showed up in my research no fewer than three times in the last month, which I take as a pretty strong sign that it’s worth articulating and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of this blogpost will be as follows. I’ll begin with a refresher on the universal approximation theorem. We’ll then state a theorem about the expressivity of shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ networks and list some cases where it applies. We’ll conclude with some experiments showing $\mathrm{ReLU}$ networks failing to learn simple cubic and quintic monomials.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;review-the-universal-approximation-theorem&quot;&gt;Review: the universal approximation theorem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAT states that a shallow neural network with biases and a nonpolynomial nonlinearity can, given sufficiently large width, approximate any function to within any desired error. More precisely, suppose we have $d$-dimensional data $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a feedforward function of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf x) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot \sigma( \mathbf{b}_i^\top \mathbf{x} + c_i),\]

&lt;p&gt;where $a_i \in \mathbb{R},\ \mathbf{b}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d,\ c_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are free parameters, and we write $\boldsymbol{\theta} \equiv {(a_i,\, \mathbf{b}_i,\, c_i)}_{i=1}^n$ to denote the tuple of all free parameters. Suppose we wish to approximate some desired function $f_* : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that the error…&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} := \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p} \left[ (f_*(\mathbf{x}) - f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}))^2 \right]\]

&lt;p&gt;is less than some threshold $\epsilon$. So long as $n$ is sufficiently large and the functions $\sigma, f_*, p$ satisfy some natural regularity conditions (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;), we can always find a way to choose $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ so that $\mathcal{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} &amp;lt; \epsilon$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-limitations-of-shallow-mathrmrelu-networks&quot;&gt;The limitations of shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ networks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nonlinearity $\sigma(z) = \mathrm{ReLU}(z) := \max(z,0)$ is nonpolynomial, so the universal approximation theorem indeed applies to shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ networks. All guarantees are off, however, if we remove the biases (i.e. set $c_i = 0$). A $\mathrm{ReLU}$ network without biases has clear expressivity limitations: for example, it can only express homogeneous functions $f(\alpha \mathbf{x}) = \alpha f(\mathbf{x})$. (For this reason, when studying shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ nets, it is common to consider only functions on the sphere.) The point of this blogpost is to show that there’s an &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; limitation which is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with an observation about the functional form of a shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 100%; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Proposition 1.&lt;/b&gt; Let $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$ be a shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ network with no biases. The network function has the linear-plus-even form

$$
f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}) = \boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x} + |\!| \mathbf{x} |\!| \cdot \mathrm{even}(\mathbf{x}),
$$

where $\mathrm{even}(\cdot)$ is a function satisfying $\mathrm{even}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{even}(-\mathbf{x})$.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;toggle-header2&quot; onclick=&quot;toggleContent2()&quot;&gt;Click for proof&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toggle-content2&quot;&gt;
The function $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$ is a sum of functions of the form $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = a_i \cdot \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{b}_i^\top \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a_i \cdot (\lvert \mathbf{b}_i^\top \mathbf{x} \rvert + \mathbf{b}_i^\top \mathbf{x})$, which has the desired form. The full function $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ therefore has the desired form.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
    function toggleContent2() {
        var content = document.querySelector('.toggle-content2');
        if (content.style.display === 'none' || content.style.display === '') {
            content.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            content.style.display = 'none';
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .toggle-header2 {
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }
    .toggle-content2 {
        display: none;
        margin-top: 10px;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-radius: 5px;
        background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any function that doesn’t have this linear-plus-even form can’t be represented by a shallow ReLU net without biases. The following definition and proposition show that if a function has this form, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be represented (or more precisely, approximated to arbitrary accuracy) by a shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Let $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$ be a shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ network with no biases and width $n$. We will say a function $f_\ast$ is &lt;em&gt;shallow&lt;/em&gt; $\mathrm{ReLU}$ &lt;em&gt;approximable&lt;/em&gt; if, for every probability distribution $p(\cdot)$ with compact support and every $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$, we may choose $n$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ such that $\mathcal{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} &amp;lt; \epsilon$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 100%; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Proposition 2.&lt;/b&gt; A continuous function $f_\star$ is shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ approximable &lt;i&gt;if and only if&lt;/i&gt; it has the linear-plus-even form

$$
f_*(\mathbf{x}) = \boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x} + |\!| \mathbf{x} |\!| \cdot \mathrm{even} \left( \frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\!| \mathbf{x} |\!|} \right)
$$

where $\mathrm{even}(\mathbf{z}) = \mathrm{even}(-\mathbf{z})$.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;toggle-header&quot; onclick=&quot;toggleContent()&quot;&gt;Click for proof sketch&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;toggle-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can prove this by first using homogeneity to only have to consider functions on the sphere, then using Fourier analysis with spherical harmonics to show that the $\mathbf{ReLU}$ basis function is enough to represent all linear and even-order polynomials. Any continuous function on the sphere may be approximated by a polynomial by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (I think I’m using that right). I’m not going to flesh out the details here, but ChatGPT can probably do it if you’re curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    function toggleContent() {
        var content = document.querySelector('.toggle-content');
        if (content.style.display === 'none' || content.style.display === '') {
            content.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            content.style.display = 'none';
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .toggle-header {
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: #f1f1f1;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }
    .toggle-content {
        display: none;
        margin-top: 10px;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #ddd;
        border-radius: 5px;
        background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of this we get a nice corollary that gives us a property to look for that tells us that no component of our function is representable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose $p(\mathbf{x}) = p(-\mathbf{x})$ and $f_\ast(\mathbf{x})$ is an odd function satisfying $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p}[f_\ast(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{x}] = 0$ for all $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ (i.e., it’s orthogonal to all linear functions). Then $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p}[f_\ast(\mathbf{x}) f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})] = 0$ for all ${\boldsymbol{\theta}}$, and when choosing $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ to minimize the MSE $\mathcal{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$, the best the network can do is to represent the zero function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We can actually prove this corollary without going through the above machinery, just integrating directly against the measure and using properties of the $\mathrm{ReLU}$ function, but it’s illuminating to go through the above propositions because we get a complete picture of the representable functions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-examples&quot;&gt;Some examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what? Does this ever actually show up? Here are two cases where it’s shown up in my recent research. Notice how you could easily think shallow $\mathrm{ReLU}$ networks could do the job if you didn’t know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinusoids on the unit circle.&lt;/strong&gt; If $\mathbf{x}$ is sampled from the unit circle, either uniformly over all angles or uniformly over evenly-spaced discrete points, then the network can’t achieve nonzero learning on functions like $\sin(k x_1)$ with $k = 3, 5, 7, \ldots$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cubic monomials and higher-order friends.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose the coordinates of $\mathbf{x}$ are sampled independently (but not necessarily identically) from mearn-zero (say, Gaussian) distributions. The network can’t achieve nonzero learning on any monomial $x_i x_j x_k$ with nonrepeated indices. The same is true of monomials of order $5, 7,$ etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last one’s pretty surprising to me! To test it, I trained bias-free $\mathrm{ReLU}$ nets, both shallow (i.e. depth 2) and deep (depth 3), on monomial functions of Gaussian distributions. As you can see, the deep net can make progress on monomials of every order, but the shallow net can make no progress on odd monomials of order $\ge 3$. Weird!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t matter at all for deep learning practitioners, but it’s useful to keep in mind for deep learning theorists. It’s useful to study the simplest model that can perform a learning task, and it’s good to know that the first thing you might try — a shallow, bias-free $\mathrm{ReLU}$ net — can’t even learn every function on the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Joey Turnbull, who first brought the experiment reported above to my attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of course, the more remarkable fact is that neural networks not only &lt;em&gt;can represent&lt;/em&gt; these functions but also &lt;em&gt;do learn&lt;/em&gt; them when trained. This is beyond the power of expressivity to explain. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer, I’ll say that I’m confident that none of the content in this blogpost is new: I’m sure many researchers over the years have realized all of this. I’m not sure where to find these results in the literature, and it’s easier for me to write this then to find a good reference, so I’m just going to develop it all from first principles, but if you know a reference, do send it my way. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The eigensystem of the Gaussian kernel w.r.t. a Gaussian measure</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blogpost composed in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/&quot;&gt;Yuxi Liu&lt;/a&gt;, who did much of the analytical legwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02561&quot;&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09796&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06176&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; have converged on the conclusion that the behavior and performance of kernel methods (and kernel regression in particular) can be simply described in terms of the eigenstructure of the task with respect to the kernel. To restate: &lt;em&gt;we can understand kernel regression to the degree we understand the eigenstructure of the task.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally not too hard to diagonalize the kernel and obtain the task eigenstructure numerically, and this has lead to a great deal of insight into the learning behavior of kernel regression. However, it’s generally quite difficult to find task eigenstructure analytically, even in simple toy cases, as it usually requires computing some complicated integrals. As every physicist knows, there are major advantages to analytical solutions: insight and intuition are often more easily extracted from symbolic solutions, and by taking limits a single analytical solution can give a system’s phenomenology in several different regimes. It thus behooves us to collect analytically solvable cases and sit with them to extract generalizing intuition. &lt;strong&gt;To that end, in this blogpost, we will give the analytical eigenstructure for the Gaussian kernel on a 1D Gaussian distribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-exactly-diagonalizable-cases-are-known&quot;&gt;What exactly diagonalizable cases are known?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first cases one turns to when one wants an exact analytical eigensystem are settings where the kernel and the domain share a &lt;em&gt;symmetry.&lt;/em&gt;
For example, with a translation-invariant kernel on a translation-invariant domain (e.g. the $d$-torus) or a rotation-invariant kernel on a rotation-invariant-domain (e.g. the $d$-sphere), the eigenfunctions are simply the harmonic functions on the domain (plane waves or spherical harmonics in the two named cases), and the eigenvalues are given by the Fourier transform of the kernel.
Some high-dimensional problems resemble these cases when the number of dimensions goes to infinity (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05355&quot;&gt;Mei + Montanari (2019)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solvable finite-dimensional cases without exact symmetry are rare.
It seems worth considering such cases, since real data rarely has such symmetry, and the eigenfunctions are only nontrivial if there’s no exact symmetry.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b2d5fff7600abe81da7b1e5af749ed9511867aed&quot;&gt;Zhu et al. (1997)&lt;/a&gt; treat a very similar case to the one we develop here.
I don’t really know any other examples of exactly solvable cases.
If you know any more, let me know.
It seems worth compiling a list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a scalar normal random variable $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution. Consider learning on this distribution with a &lt;em&gt;Gaussian kernel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[K(x,y)=e^{-\frac{(x-y)^2}{2 w^2}}\]

&lt;p&gt;where $w$ is the width of the kernel. We seek an &lt;em&gt;eigendecomposition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[K(x,y) = \sum_k \lambda_k \, \phi_k(x) \, \phi_k(y),\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\lbrace \lambda_k \rbrace$ are nonnegative eigenvalues and $\lbrace \phi_k \rbrace$ are eigenfunctions satisfying the orthonormality relation&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbb{E}_x[\phi_k(x) \phi_\ell(x)] = \delta_{k\ell}.\]

&lt;p&gt;We refer to $\lbrace \lambda_k \rbrace$ and $\lbrace \phi_k \rbrace$ together as the kernel &lt;em&gt;eigensystem&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;eigenstructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let $h_k(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{k!}} \text{He}_k(x)$ denote the (rescaled) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials&quot;&gt;probabilist’s Hermite polynomials&lt;/a&gt;. The normalization prefactor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k!}}$ is chosen so that $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[h_k^2(x)] = 1$.&lt;/p&gt;

The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given by:

$$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the eigenfunctions resemble the eigenfunctions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator&quot;&gt;quantum harmonic oscillator&lt;/a&gt; but  with different scale factors $\alpha \neq\beta$ on the exponential and Hermite components. The eigenvalues are a geometric series with ratio $r &amp;lt; 1$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obtaining-the-answer&quot;&gt;Obtaining the answer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We obtained these eigenfunctions treating Equations 1,2 as an ansatz and solving for $\alpha, \beta, c, r$. This is doable with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehler_kernel&quot;&gt;Mehler’s formula&lt;/a&gt; and algebraic manipulation. &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/gaussian_kernel_eigendecomp_derivation.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a step-by-step derivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualizing-the-eigenstructure&quot;&gt;Visualizing the eigenstructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can plot the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and compare analytical formulae with numerics to make sure we’re right. &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vz0RZuMxrgGGz9aq9e4l4PH8p9jIIBXG?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; a colab notebook that does so, and here’s the resulting plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/analytical_gaussian_eigendecompositions/1d_eigenfn_viz.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each row shows the eigenstructure for a different ratio $\frac{w^2}{\sigma^2}$. The leftmost plot in each row is a simple visualization of the Gaussian PDF (which here always has $\sigma^2 = 1$) and the Gaussian kernel. The middle plot in each row shows the first five kernel eigenfunctions with theoretical curves overlaid for comparison. The rightmost plot in each row shows the kernel eigenvalues. We find that the experimental eigenvalues indeed follow the predicted geometric descent (with small deflections due to numerical error).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eigenstructure-in-two-limits&quot;&gt;Eigenstructure in two limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the top and bottow rows in the above figure, we get the feeling it might be informative to examine the $\sigma^2 \gg w^2$ and $\sigma^2 \ll w^2$ limits of our analytical expressions. Here’s what you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;narrow-kernel-sigma2-gg-w2&quot;&gt;Narrow kernel: $\sigma^2 \gg w^2$&lt;/h3&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
    \alpha &amp;amp;\approx \sqrt{\sigma w}, \\[6pt]
    \beta &amp;amp;\approx \sqrt{\frac{\sigma w}{2}}, \\[6pt]
    c &amp;amp;\approx \left( \frac{2 \sigma}{w} \right)^{1/4}, \\[6pt]
    r &amp;amp;\approx 1.
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regime, the scale factors $\alpha, \beta$ are the same up to a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, and the resulting eigenfunctions $\phi_k$ are exactly the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator (note that we’re using probabilist’s instead of physicist’s Hermite polynomials). This makes sense, as we’d expect the eigenfunctions of a sufficiently narrow Gaussian kernel to converge to the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. The ratio $r = \frac{\lambda_{k+1}}{\lambda_k}$ approaches $1$, which tells us that the top eigenfunctions have practically identical eigenvalues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wide-kernel-sigma2-ll-w2&quot;&gt;Wide kernel: $\sigma^2 \ll w^2$&lt;/h3&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
    \alpha &amp;amp;\approx w, \\[6pt]
    \beta &amp;amp;\approx \sigma, \\[6pt]
    c &amp;amp;\approx 1, \\[6pt]
    r &amp;amp;\approx \frac{\sigma^2}{w^2}.
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the more interesting regime. In this case, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ decouple, and in fact $\alpha \approx w \gg \sigma$ is so wide that the exponential factor in the functional form of $\phi_k(x)$ becomes irrelevant, and we’re left with just a Hermite polynomial. You can see this in the bottom row of the figure above: the eigenfunctions start to just look like polynomials of increasing order. The eigenvalue ratio $r \approx \frac{\sigma^2}{w^2}$ approaches &lt;em&gt;the ratio of the distribution variance to the kernel variance.&lt;/em&gt; These two facts are the main things I wanted to get out of this calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-hermite-are-the-eigenfunctions-for-varying-values-of-sigma2--w2&quot;&gt;How “Hermite” are the eigenfunctions for varying values of $\sigma^2 / w^2$?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us perform a numerical experiment: we shall compute the true kernel eigenfunctions ${\phi_k}$, compute the Hermite polynomials ${h_k}$, and for each $k$, find the cosine similarity 
\(\frac{\langle \phi_k, h_k \rangle}{\| h_k \|}\)
where the inner product 
\(\langle f, g \rangle = \mathbb{E}_x[f(x) g(x)]\)
is the $L^2$ inner product w.r.t. the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are plotted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/analytical_gaussian_eigendecompositions/eigenfn_hermite_similarity.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at larger $k$, we require smaller $\gamma \equiv \frac{\sigma^2}{w^2}$ to approach Hermiteness, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\gamma &amp;lt; 0.1$ is generally small enough, at least up to $k = 3$ or $4$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Implications and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway here is that so long as $\sigma^2$ is sufficiently smaller than $w^2$ — &lt;em&gt;and we don’t care exactly how small&lt;/em&gt; — the kernel’s “eigenfeatures” are simply the “Hermite features” of the data. In this regime, the kernel eigenvalues are simply powers of $\frac{\sigma^2}{w^2}$. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s next? It’s likely that a more general class of kernels (including in higher dimension) can be solved using these techniques, and if that’s the case, it’s worth compiling these exactly solvable cases and extracting what intuition we can. Even with this 1D Gaussian case, though, there are probably ways to take this result and apply its intuition to kernel learning problems on (potentially realistic) high-dimensional data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The optimal low-rank solution for multivariate linear regression</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider linear regression with squared error in which we wish to choose a matrix $\mathbf{W}$ to minimize&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{E} \equiv \mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \sim \mu}\left[ |\!| \mathbf{W}x - y |\!|^2 \right] = \text{Tr}\left[ \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx} \mathbf{W}^T - 2 \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xy} + \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{yy}} \right],\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx} = \mathbb{E}[x x^T]$ and so on, under the constraint that $\mathbf{W}$ may be at most rank $k$. Assume that $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx}$ is full rank (i.e., we are underparameterized). We may rewrite this loss as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{E} = |\!| \tilde{\mathbf{W}} - \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yx} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx}^{-1/2} |\!|_F^2,\]

&lt;p&gt;where $\tilde{\mathbf{W}} \equiv \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1/2}$. It is then clear that the optimal rank-$k$ choice for $\tilde{\mathbf{W}}$ is&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tilde{\mathbf{W}}_*^{(k)} = \text{topsvd}_k(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yx} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx}^{-1/2} ),\]

&lt;p&gt;where the operator $\text{topsvd}_k(\cdot)$ returns the matrix comprised of the top $k$ singular directions of its argument. We thus conclude that the optimal rank-$k$ model matrix is&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathbf{W}_*^{(k)} = \text{topsvd}_k(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yx} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx}^{-1/2} ) \boldsymbol{\Sigma_{xx}}^{-1/2}.\]

&lt;p&gt;When the rank is unconstrained and $k$ is maximal, we find that $\mathbf{W}_* = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{yx} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{xx}^{-1}$ as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
