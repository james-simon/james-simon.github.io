    <p>This clue uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. That’s for a simple reason: each letter is made of a unique network of nodes and lines (a graph). To find the solution, solvers had to break the word ANSWER into its component parts, each of which is a graph, and find the letters in the puzzle’s text whose graphs match them. As the clue states, form is irrelevant - all 26 letter graphs can be bent and twisted while still uniquely mapping to the same letter.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, here are the first two letters of the solution:</p>
