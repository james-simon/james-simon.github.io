> To evaluate the developmental ontogeny of spontaneous circuit activity,
we compared two different areas of sensory cortex that are also differentiated by sensory inputs
that follow different developmental timelines.
We imaged neuronal populations in acute coronal slices of mouse neocortex taken
from postnatal days 3 through 15.
We observed a consistent developmental trajectory of spontaneous activity,
suggesting a consistent pattern for cortical microcircuit development:
anatomical modules are wired together by coherent activations into functional circuits.

The final version of my research paper with [Jason MacLean](http://www.macleanlab.com/)
on the developmental time course of spontaneous activity in mouse cortex is now
[available through the Journal of Neurophysiology](http://jn.physiology.org/content/early/2016/04/29/jn.00172.2016.abstract).

Check it out! You can also read a layman's summary [here](research).
