I've started doing some short webinars
on core math topics in machine learning
for
[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.com),
a startup that offers a really cool experiment tracking,
visualization, and sharing tool.

The first webinar,
[_How Linear Algebra is Not Like Algebra_](https://bit.ly/2RIELUW),
presents Linear Algebra from a programmer's perspective:
every vector/matrix/tensor is a function, shapes are types,
and matrix multiplication is composition of functions.

The second webinar
[_Look Mom, No Indices!_](https://bit.ly/3bgDpsw),
introduces an index-free style of computing gradients
for functions that take vectors and matrices as inputs.
It's a teaser for
[this blog post series]({{site.url}}/math/2018/03/06/frechet-derivative-introduction.html).
