[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/charlesfrye/DSW2018-tutorials/master)

As part of this year's
[Data Science Workshop](https://gdso.berkeley.edu/workshop.html)
at Berkeley,
I put on a tutorial on using Jupyter Notebooks:
a quick sprint over the basics and then examples for
inline animations and videos, embedded iframes,
and interactive plotting!

Click the badge above to launch the tutorial on binder.
You'll want to check out the `JupyterNotebookForGreatGood` folder.

Check out the repo it works off of
[here](https://github.com/charlesfrye/DSW2018-tutorials),
where you can find local installation instructions.
