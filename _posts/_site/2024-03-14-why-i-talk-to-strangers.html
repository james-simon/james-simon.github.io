<p>i met someone today<br />
and in the course of conversation<br />
told her about you<br />
and your love of people<br />
and what I learned<br />
and how it changed me</p>

<p>and she said:<br />
that sounds good and all<br />
but i don’t see the point<br />
in connecting with someone<br />
i will never see again.</p>

<p>and so i thought for a moment<br />
and i said<br />
when you look at a flower<br />
do you fret<br />
that your examination is a waste of time<br />
because you will never see that flower again?</p>

<p>and in any case<br />
the things you see in that flower<br />
the details you notice in its petals, its leaves, its shape, its hue<br />
you will surely see in other flowers<br />
and to look at one is in some sense to look at them all<br />
and teaches you to better see<br />
each future flower.</p>

<p>returning to people<br />
all you see in a stranger<br />
you will surely see again in countless others –<br />
strangers, friends, and loved ones –<br />
and learning about a stranger<br />
is in fact learning about humanity,<br />
each individual a view of the whole<br />
and so infinitely more resplendent<br />
if you know that secret.</p>

<p>but it goes deeper<br />
because unlike with flowers,<br />
here you are that type of thing<br />
and you can learn about yourself<br />
in a subway chat with a stranger<br />
whose name you do not know<br />
and whose path you do not share.<br />
you may see yourself reflected in their eyes,<br />
see a life you might have lived,<br />
or a joy you have forgotten,<br />
or a struggle you have not known but will soon.<br />
humans are not so different<br />
and i see now that each gives a view of me<br />
and that, i said,<br />
is why i talk to strangers.</p>

<p>our conversation ran its course<br />
and we went our separate ways<br />
drifting back to our separate lives<br />
and i may well never see her again<br />
but that, of course, isn’t the point<br />
and i am glowing regardless<br />
with the feeling<br />
of having caught<br />
a glimpse of the whole</p>
