<!-- This one is exactly what it sounds like. -->
<p>Of all my recent years’ varied adventures, the most memorable ten seconds might well have been when my housemate tossed me an egg and I caught it in my mouth.
The hour was 9am.
The egg was raw.
The music was high.
It was our first try.
It looked a little like this.</p>

</video>
</p>

<p>I suppose one could look for a deeper meaning here, some lesson on spontanaeity or the pursuit of the comic absurd or the value of attempting things that seem impossible, but no: this one’s just an egg, and it was awesome.
The satisfying ka-<em>chunk</em> of the egg clinking off my teeth and lodging unbroken in my mouth like a heavy-duty mechanism locking into place stayed with me all day.</p>
