i met someone today\
and in the course of conversation\
told her about you\
and your love of people\
and what I learned\
and how it changed me

and she said:\
that sounds good and all\
but i don't see the point\
in connecting with someone\
i will never see again.

and so i thought for a moment\
and i said\
when you look at a flower\
do you fret\
that your examination is a waste of time\
because you will never see that flower again?

and in any case\
the things you see in that flower\
the details you notice in its petals, its leaves, its shape, its hue\
you will surely see in other flowers\
and to look at one is in some sense to look at them all\
and teaches you to better see\
each future flower.

returning to people\
all you see in a stranger\
you will surely see again in countless others --\
strangers, friends, and loved ones --\
and learning about a stranger\
is in fact learning about humanity,\
each individual a view of the whole\
and so infinitely more resplendent\
if you know that secret.

but it goes deeper\
because unlike with flowers,\
here you are that type of thing\
and you can learn about yourself\
in a subway chat with a stranger\
whose name you do not know\
and whose path you do not share.\
you may see yourself reflected in their eyes,\
see a life you might have lived,\
or a joy you have forgotten,\
or a struggle you have not known but will soon.\
humans are not so different\
and i see now that each gives a view of me\
and that, i said,\
is why i talk to strangers.

our conversation ran its course\
and we went our separate ways\
drifting back to our separate lives\
and i may well never see her again\
but that, of course, isn't the point\
and i am glowing regardless\
with the feeling\
of having caught\
a glimpse of humanity
