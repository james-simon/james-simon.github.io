<!-- This one is exactly what it sounds like. -->
Of all my recent years' varied adventures, the most memorable ten seconds might well have been when my housemate tossed me an egg and I caught it in my mouth.
The hour was 9am.
The egg was raw.
The music was high.
It was our first try.
It looked a little like this.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline width="80%" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">
    <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/eggman/EGGMAN.MP4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</p>

I suppose one could look for a deeper meaning here, some lesson on spontanaeity or the pursuit of the comic absurd or the value of attempting things that seem impossible, but no: this one's just an egg, and it was awesome.
The satisfying ka-*chunk* of the egg clinking off my teeth and lodging unbroken in my mouth like a heavy-duty mechanism locking into place stayed with me all day.
