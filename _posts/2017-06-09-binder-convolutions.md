$$ g * f(t) = \sum_{\tau+\Delta = t} g(\tau) \cdot f(\Delta) $$

Previously, I posted a link to some Jupyter-based
[tutorials on convolution](http://charlesfrye.github.io/external/2016/03/27/convolutions.html)
that I wrote.
In order to use them,
you needed to install an appropriate computing environment.

Now, thanks to the folks at [binder](mybinder.org)
and the magic of the cloud,
you can just click
[this link](https://beta.mybinder.org/repo/charlesfrye/Convolution-Tutorial)
and use them with nothing more than a web browser.

Neat!
