> In the next section, we define an analogous algorithm for finding critical points. That is, we again try to solve a root-finding problem with Newton-Raphson, but this introduces a division, which we reformulate as an optimization problem.

Today a [short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05273) I wrote posted to the arXiV.
It's on a cute connection between the algorithm I use to find the critical points of neural network losses and the algorithm used to compute square roots to high accuracy.

Check out [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/charles_irl/status/1139232020519768064) for a layman-friendly explanation.
