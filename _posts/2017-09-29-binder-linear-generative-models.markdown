Inspired by the discussion
on linear factor models in Chapter 13 of
[Deep Learning](deeplearningbook.org)
by Courville, Goodfellow, and Bengio,
I wrote a tutorial notebook on
linear generative models,
including probabilistic PCA,
Factor Analysis,
and Sparse Coding,
with an emphasis on visualizing the
data that is generated by each model.

You can download the notebook yourself
[from GitHub](https://github.com/charlesfrye/LinearGenerativeModels-Tutorial)
or you can click the badge below to interact with it in your browser
without needing a compatible Python computational environment on your machine.
