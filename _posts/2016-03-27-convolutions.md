I recently gave a tutorial on convolutions.
You can check out the IPython Notebooks at the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/neuro-data-mining/materials)
for Berkeley's Neuro Data Mining Group.

For more information about the group, check out
[our website](https://sites.google.com/site/neurodatamininggroup/resources).
Come join us if you're interested!
