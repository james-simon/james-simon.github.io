Two friends asked me to play Mendelssohn's Wedding March from *A Midsummer Night's Dream* at their ceremony. After a day learning the piece and a few hours in GarageBand, I sent them this and told them they'd be getting the Muppets version.

*Congratulations to Isaac Harris and Sophia Mock, thanks to Bennett Witcher for some good Muppet noises, and apologies to Jim Henson. Bonus points if you noticed that the voices are saying `do`, `re`, `mi`, `fa`, `sol`, `la`, and `ti`.*
