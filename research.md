## Neural Network Loss Surfaces

{:.gallery}
![1d-dlae]

At the
[Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/),
I studied the loss surfaces of artificial neural networks,
which underlie many recent advances in machine learning and AI.

My goal is to understand how the geometric properties of these surfaces,
like their curvature,
help give rise to the unreasonable effectiveness of neural networks.
Check out
[this arXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10603)
for an in-depth comparison of numerical algorithms
for computing these quantities
and
[this tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05273)
for a "derivation" of the best-performing algorithm
as a slight upgrade to a method for computing square roots.
The end result of this research
was the discovery of an interesting new class of points
on neural network loss surfaces,
gradient-flat points,
which cause trouble for second-order methods.

## The Development of Spontaneous Activity

In the [laboratory of Jason MacLean](http://macleanlab.com),
I studied the development of spontaneous activity patterns
in brain slices taken from mice during the first two weeks of life.

I published my research in [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00172.2016).
In short, we discovered that spontaneous activity starts out
only recruiting very small clusters of cells, only a hundred microns across.
The activations then suddenly blossom nine days after birth
into a complicated mixture of small clusters of cells,
giant waves, and medium-sized groups of cells spread over about a millimeter.
After the mouse is two weeks old, the activity becomes more stereotyped again,
but now all of the activations are medium-sized and spread out.

This research catalogued these spontaneous patterns
at a novel scale and in brain areas that hadn't been previously studied.
Understanding the properties of these patterns is important for
understanding how the brain develops its wiring and therefore all of its functions,
including sensation, learning, and action.
Our findings corroborated other research that suggests that much of this wiring process
is innate and independent of sensory input, and further showed that the process
proceeds at the same pace in multiple areas of the brain.

## MDMA and Social Cognition in Human Subjects

As an undergraduate, I worked on an honors thesis in the
[laboratory of Harriet de Wit](http://psychiatry.bsd.uchicago.edu/hbpl/).
There, I studied the effects of MDMA, also known as "Ecstasy" or "Molly",
on the cognitive responses of human beings to simulated social rejection and acceptance.

The thesis was published in [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316346).
We showed that research participants reported increased negative emotions,
including reduced self-esteem,
when exposed to a social rejection simulation called
["Cyberball"](https://cyberball.wikispaces.com/),
pictured above.
When the participants were given MDMA, however,
they were less saddened by the social rejection simulation
and more accurately reported the magnitude of their rejection.

This research provided useful information about the psychological mechanism
behind the effects of MDMA.
This is particularly helpful for the growing movement of physicians and scientists
who aim to [develop MDMA-assisted psychotherapy](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma?id=5374),
particularly for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Our research indicated that humans exposed to MDMA weren't simply "getting high"
and therefore becoming blunted to negative emotions,
but were actually better-equipped to perceive and deal with a minor
negative social experience.
