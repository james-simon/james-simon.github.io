Following the poem, the first step in solving this was to take find the top-level domain of each country whose flag was shown.  They're shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/flagssol1.png" width="100%" />
</p>

Plotting the sequences above - on a periodic table instead of a map - gives the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{site.imgurl}}/flagssol2.png" width="100%" />
</p>

The paths, in order, spell WORLD.
