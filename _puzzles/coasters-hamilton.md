These coaster pieces fit together like a puzzle into the following arrangement:

<p align="center">
  <img style="float: center; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/coasters/coasters_sol1.png" width="30%" />
</p>

The arrows on each piece trace out a path through the completed puzzle. The letters along the path spell BURRENEMY.

<p align="center">
  <img style="float: center; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/coasters/coasters_sol2.png" width="30%" />
</p>

The noted enemy of Burr was HAMILTON, the answer to this puzzle.
