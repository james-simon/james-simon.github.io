## Data Science for Research Psychology

Introductory stats is usually taught in a frequentist style,
with a huge emphasis on rote memorization of formulas and recipes
for null hypothesis significance testing.
I developed this course in an attempt to teach some of that core material
in a more modern way:
with computational Bayesian methods.
This approach is less akin learning a collection of recipes
in order to cook specific dishes
and more akin to learning a language
in order to read and write fluently.
Materials are
[available online]({{site.url}}/psych101d)
as a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks,
including automatic cloud deployment.

## Applied Statistics for Neuroscience

I developed a course in statistics
aimed at graduate students in neuroscience
who need to add quantitative skills,
like probability and programming,
to their toolbox.
It is taught yearly at UC Berkeley
and is

## Predicting Soil Properties from Infrared Spectra

As part of the
[CDIPS Data Science Workshop](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/dsw/),
I worked with a team to develop a collection of tutorial
Jupyter notebooks, which we deployed to the web using
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

## emojify.io

At [emojify.io](http://emojify.io), you can create "fractals" made out of emojis.
The underlying statistical model is based on the
["dead leaves" model of natural scenes](http://stat.fsu.edu/~anuj/pdf/papers/JMIV03.pdf),
which combine *occlusion* and *scale invariance*.
Occlusion means that objects placed on the canvas cover up, or occlude,
objects that are behind them.
Scale invariance means that the relationships between pixels do not change as you zoom in or out.

The SVG image specification is an excellent match for this image model.
Objects are placed on a canvas, and the objects that are placed later
occlude objects placed before.
Scale-invariance can be had on the cheap thanks to the "scalable"
part of "scalable vector graphics".

Since emojis are SVG objects, it was easy to extend this image model
away from the simple geometric shapes usually used in research.

Shout out to my friend [Derek Johnston](https://github.com/dcjohnston/),
who wrote the web-facing components of the app.

## Foundational Neuroscience Blog

{: style="text-align: center"}

As part of my qualifying exam, I was required to know the answers
to about 100 questions on the foundations of neuroscience.
In order to focus my studying, I decided to write
[a blog](http://charlesfrye.github.io/FoundationalNeuroscience)
detailing my answers to all of the questions.

I made it through about 40 by the time the exam rolled around.
Check it out if you're interested in molecular or cellular neurobiology,
computational neuroscience, and the connections between the two.

The image above shows the output cable of a neuron, also known as an *axon*,
as it grows towards its target. Each differently-colored object represents
a different kind of signaling that can change the behavior of the axon as it grows.

## 1992 Philadelphia Eagles

One evening in 2013, some talented musicians and also me
recorded an
[improvisational album of electro-acoustic music](http://magicafternoon.com/album/bro-love)
as "The 1992 Philadelphia Eagles".
I'm the clarinet.
